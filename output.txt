JFK / McAdams's Kennedy Assassination Home Page The Kennedy Assassination By John McAdams © 1995-2021 "He didn't even have the satisfaction of being killed for civil rights . . . . It's — it had to be some silly little Communist." — Jackie Kennedy, on hearing that a leftist had been arrested for her husband's murder. I t's the most controversial case in modern American history. Did Lee Harvey Oswald kill John Kennedy by himself, or did a conspiracy do it? And if a conspiracy did it, did the conspiracy include Oswald? If you are like most Americans, you believe that a conspiracy killed Kennedy. And if you are like most Americans, you have heard a vast number of bogus factoids about the case. This web site is dedicated to debunking the mass of misinformation and disinformation surrounding the murder of JFK. If you are believer in Oswald as a lone gunman, you are likely to enjoy this web site, since most of that misinformation and disinformation has come from conspiracists. But if you are a sophisticated conspiracist, you likely understand that the mass of silly nonsense in conspiracy books and documentaries does no service to the cause of truth in the assassination, and simply buries the "case for conspiracy" under layers of bunk. Regardless of what you believe, several web sites, mostly conspiracy-oriented are worth checking out. And you may also want to check out my list of recommended books on the assassination . What sort of evidence is there? Dealey Plaza What about those witnesses? Didn't everyone hear shots from the Grassy Knoll? What about the Tague wounding? Who was the "Umbrella Man?" Was the rifle recovered really a Mauser? Does "acoustic evidence" show a shot from the Grassy Knoll? Were the Three Tramps suspicious? How could Kennedy's head go "back and to the left?" The Single Bullet Theory You've seen Kevin Costner give the conspiracy version of the Single Bullet theory. You know: Connally seated directly in front of Kennedy, at the same height, and facing straight ahead. Was that really what happened? Lee Harvey Oswald What sort of person was he? Did he really have "Top Secret" security clearance? Did he shoot at General Walker? Were there two Oswalds? If Oswald shot Kennedy, what was his motive? Was the man exhumed in 1981 really somebody besides Oswald? Jim Garrison and New Orleans Did Oswald really share an office with Guy Banister? Did Clay Shaw really use the alias "Clay Bertrand?" Why did Oliver Stone make a movie about the Shaw trial and not even mention Perry Raymond Russo? Did David Ferrie die a "mysterious death?" What about Jim Garrison and the Mafia? Medical Evidence Did the bullet that hit Kennedy in the back penetrate only an inch and fall out? Was Kennedy hit in the head by a bullet from in front? Are the autopsy photos and x-rays faked? Did all the doctors at Parkland Hospital believe that Kennedy was hit in the front of the neck, and if so, are their opinions decisive evidence that that is what happened? Was the back of Kennedy's head blown out? Are the autopsy photos faked? Bogus Evidence Did you know that all the evidence in this case proven to be forged has been on the conspiracy side? One key piece originated with the KGB! Did you know that the "mysterious deaths" are virtually all not so "mysterious" when you look at them closely? Do you trust authors like Mark Lane to tell you the truth about what witnesses said? Jack Ruby The "lone nut" theory of the assassination is really the "two lone nuts" theory. What sort of person was Jack Ruby? A mobster? An intelligence agent? A small-time hustler? The sort of volatile character who might really have shot Oswald out of righteous anger? Oliver Stone's Movie "JFK" We expect Hollywood movies to take some liberties with the historical record. But what do we think when Hollywood turns history on its head? Oliver Stone wants to overturn the verdict in the Clay Shaw trial. The jury found that District Attorney Jim Garrison had no case — so Stone invents a case on celluloid. Just how honest was Oliver Stone, Shaw's Hollywood prosecutor? John Kennedy: Liberal Martyr? For some in the conspiracy crowd, John Kennedy was a liberal saint, who was going to implement policies that would bring America into a new Utopia. So, of course, a threatened Power Elite had to kill him. Was Kennedy the kind of left liberal who threatened established interests? Was he a hero of Civil Rights? Had he decided to pull out of Vietnam? Historian Eric Paddon dissects these claims in a series of essays based on his posts on the Internet. Assassination Logic Some notions about logic, probability and statistics necessarily underlie all discussion of "conspiracy" or "lone assassin." Does the lone assassination theory involve too many implausible "coincidences?" Are there a suspicious number of "connections" between various figures in the case? Is the Single Bullet Theory highly "improbable?" Assassination Witnesses In writings about the assassination, as in real-world criminal justice, witness testimony looms large. But just how reliable are the witnesses? How many witnesses are just flat out telling tall tales? How often are apparently sober and reliable witnesses just flat wrong? Did a Secret Service Agent Shoot JFK by Accident? It's plausible enough that some people accept it, although very few committed buffs do: the notion that assassination was a friendly fire incident. Supposedly, Agent George Hickey, riding in the follow-up car, accidently shot the president. This theory has been repeatedly debunked, most recently by Peter Mucha in the Philadelphia Inquirer , and by Dale Myers and Gus Russo in an article on Myers site . The Assassination Context What we think about the assassination is dependent on what we think about history, and about the behavior of government officials and bureaucrats. Was Kennedy a radical who threatened the status quo? Did top administration officials order a coverup of a conspiracy soon after the assassination? If the FBI and the CIA withhold documents, does this mean that they are protecting assassination conspirators? Release the Documents! This has long been the cry of the conspiracy theorists. Supposedly, the documents show that a conspiracy killed Kennedy. In fact, the government in the 1990s released a massive number of documents. The Assassination Records Review Board had a mandate to identify and oversee the release of documents in government hands, and in private hands. Hear History Happen Recording devices monitored the two radio channels used by the Dallas Police Department, and these recordings are a vivid "real time" account of the frenzy of activity that followed the shooting. Here are selected audio clips beginning a couple of minutes before the assassination and ending with the arrest of Oswald in the Texas Theatre. A Half Century of Assassination Literature In the more than half century since 1963, the literature on the assassination has taken several twists and turns, from early works that questioned the use of evidence by the Warren Commission, to examinations of the medical evidence, to more recent decades when theories of massive fakery of evidence have dominated. Webmaster John McAdams examines this progression, highlighting important works both defending the lone assassination theory and those (much more numerous) attacking it. Newsgroup Do you want to ask for more information, or discuss or debate some of the issues raised here? The moderated newsgroup: alt.assassination.jfk Run by webmaster John McAdams, is the place to go — whether you are a "newbie" with questions to ask, or a researcher with some evidence you want to present to the research community. Featured Articles I don't necessarily agree with all the conclusions these authors have drawn, but everything here is a solid piece of work that deserves your attention. All are copyrighted, and all posted here with permission. Josiah Thompson was the author of a conspiracy classic titled Six Seconds in Dallas , and in the more than half century since has continued to study the case. His most recent volume, Last Second in Dallas , shows him looking at a mass of evidence from Dealey Plaza, and putting it together in a vastly implausible way, as this review by Louis T. Girdler shows. Girdler sees Thompson falling prey to what he accuses the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee of: confirmation bias. While Jim Garrison was was discredited, even among conspiracy-oriented researchers, some authors have tried to rehabilitate him. This essay from Fred Litwin’s book On the Trail of Delusion , documents the lunacy of the Garrison investigation with a plethora of heretofore unseen primary source documents. Many of these documents can be found online on Litwin’s blog. Joan Mellen's book Faustian Bargains: Lyndon Johnson and Mac Wallace in the Robber Baron Culture of Texas is a book by a conspiracy author that decisively debunks one conspiracy theory: the notion that one Mac Wallace was LBJ's hit man in Texas, and later in Dealey Plaza. Our review of the book points out some weaknesses, but also notes some strengths. David Talbot's book The Devil’s Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of America’s Secret Government fingers CIA director Allen Dulles as the person who plotted and directed the assassination, and protrays him as a generally evil person. Unfortunately, the book is rather deficient as history, as explained by David M. Barrett in this review . A good, well-reasoned overview of the assassination from someone skeptical of conspiracy theories is Dave Reitzes " JFK Conspiracy Theories at 50: How the Skeptics Got It Wrong and Why It Matters ." It's a good "first read" for somebody who had read just conspiracy books (or seen conspiracy documentaries) and wants to see the other side of the issue. Richard Belzer's book Hit List has gotten a fair amount of attention recently. It's an extended explication of the supposed "mystery deaths" associated with the assassination. Unfortunately, as Marilyn Elias explains in her review of the book , it's the sort of book one would write if one surfs conspiracy sites on the Internet, and believes everything one finds there. Jeff Morley is a journalist who has gotten some good press recently for his attempts to pry documents he thinks are related to the JFK assassination from the CIA. Most everybody applauds these efforts, but some have taken him to task for making claims that go far beyond the evidence he (or anybody else) has. Dale Myers and Gus Russo critique a variety of Morley's assertions in "Drums of Conspiracy" and "Fanning Wisps of Smoke." The notion that Kennedy was killed because he intended to withdraw from Vietnam has become the conventional wisdom among conspiracists, and a recent treatment of that theory, James W. Douglass' JFK and the Unspeakable , has drawn some attention. But unfortunately, the author not only distorts history, but unintentionally paints a very unflattering portrait of JFK. See our review of the book here . Zombie assassins? The notion that "Manchurian candidate" assassins might be "programmed" to commit murder has been a recurring one. Most often invoked in the murder of Robert Kennedy, it has also surfaced in the JFK assassination. British author Mel Ayton explores this issue in his essay "Bogus Manchurian Candidate Theories." A recent book by Abraham Bolden tells a most interesting story about the first black Secret Service agent who supposedly knew about conspiratorial goings-on in Chicago, and who was (he claims) framed, convicted and sent to jail on charges of corruption. The media have been rather credulous about his account , but in fact he was almost certainly guilty as charged . Indeed, when the House Select Committee examined his claims in the late 1970s, they found them to lack credibility . While the mainstream media is suitably skeptical when the conspiracy card is played, they suspend that skepticism when the race card is played. Garrisonites are a rather peculiar and paranoid cult among conspiracy believers, and Joan Mellen's book A Farewell to Justice is the latest to defend District Attorney Jim Garrison, whose ill-conceived campaign to convict Clay Shaw of the JFK assassination was the subject of the movie "JFK." Yet, like the movie, Mellen has fallen into the trap of believing the most incredible sources and adopting the most outlandish theories in an attempt to vindicate the DA, as Patricia Lambert shows in this review of the book . In another essay, Dave Reitzes discusses Garrison's central, critical witness, a fellow named Perry Raymond Russo. Mellen accepts his testimony, which Reitzes shows was vastly unreliable . Finally, Lambert shows how Mellen blew off the testimony of a key reliable witness , one Dr. Frank Silva, when it conflicted with the Garrison version of events. When a reputable historian publishes a JFK assassination book with a reputable academic press, it should be judicious in its use of sources and prudent in its judgments. But, alas, David Kaiser's book The Road to Dallas turns out to be just another conspiracy book, not too different from scores of others. Read a review by webmaster John McAdams on the e-zine Washington Decoded . Nothing about the assassination is more important than the issue of when the shots in Dealey Plaza were fired. Pick your timing, and it may be consistent with or entirely debunk a single shooter in the Texas School Book Depository. A new essay by Kenneth R. Scearce supports a new theory about the timing that puts the first shot far earlier than anybody has heretofore theorized. Of course, this theory has generated controversy, so you might want to check out a reply from computer animation specialist Dale Myers . Author David Talbot ought to the the sort of sober and serious person we would expect a member of the mainstream media to be on the assassination, but alas he isn't. Veteran journalist Don Bohning, who long reported on Talbot's prime suspects in the Miami Cuban community, finds Talbot's book Brothers to be pretty much another buff book , with credulous acceptance of suspect witnesses and a very selective use of the documentary record. Mel Ayton has a new essay on Conspiracy Thinking and the John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Assassinations." Ayton believes that all conspiracy thinking has several common threads. There has been a recent spate of new books and new theories about the assassination, including a German television documentary called "Rendezvous With Death" from Wilfried Huismann and Gus Russo and the book Ultimate Sacrifice by Lamar Waldron and Thom Hartmann. Do we have any compelling new evidence or interpretations here, or is this just more unsupported conspiracy theorizing? A new essay by Mel Ayton critically examines the evidence. "Rendezvous With Death" , claims to have discovered compelling new evidence that Fidel Castro had John Kennedy killed, using Lee Oswald as hit man and patsy. It has received a mixed reception, at best . A new essay by David Lifton accepts, for the sake of argument, the data produced by the authors of "Rendezvous With Death" and points out that it could be interpreted in a way very different from what the documentary proposes. The History Channel has a record of showing reasonably reliable documentaries on subjects like wars, Nazis, the history of popular culture and the like. But their record on the Kennedy assassination is abysmal. The series "The Men Who Killed Kennedy" has a record of touting the most implausible and bizarre theories . But they managed to reach a new low with an episode titled "The Guilty Men" which fingered Lyndon Johnson as the prime mover behind the assassination. In this article, journalist and historian Max Holland dissects the entire series , and especially the installment on LBJ. And veteran JFK researcher Dave Perry critiques the reliability of the supposed "evidence" in an article from his website . And one of the accused conspirators, Malcolm Liggett, sued The History Channel over the supposed "documentary" and received a settlement . The "acoustic evidence" got a boost in 2001, when a scientist named D.B. Thomas published an article claiming to have corrected the statistical treatment in earlier studies and found clear evidence of a shot from the Grassy Knoll . However, a recent careful study of the timing on the events on the Dallas Police tape by Michael O'Dell shows that the "shots" happened too late to actually be shots . Thus the "acoustic evidence" was to acoustic science what cold fusion was to physics: an example of how even reputable scientists can jump to conclusions when faced with the possibility of an "explosive" discovery. Of course there are all kinds of wild and woolly theories connecting Oswald to the CIA. But some responsible and sober researchers have argued that the Agency knew more about and had a more intense interest in Oswald than they have ever admitted. One such researcher is Jefferson Morley, world news editor of washingtonpost.com . His article "What Jane Roman Said" outlines the evidence. Among conspiracy-oriented researchers, there is a deep gulf between the more moderate and sensible ones, and those who'll promote any bogus piece of "conspiracy evidence." Ulric Shannon is one of the former, and he explains in this essay why he thinks the "I'll believe anything that implies conspiracy" crowd is so harmful. Researcher Bill Drenas debuted his essay "Car #10, Where Are You" on this web site in 1997. The current version has some minor factual corrections and much new material. Not pushing any conspiracy theory, but not a debunking exercise either, it's a very careful attempt to nail down Tippit's whereabouts — minute by minute — on the day he died. A related essay from Drenas involves the Top Ten Record Shop . This classic Oak Cliff location was where Officer Tippit stopped shortly before he was shot. It's still in business, and you'll almost certainly want to visit when you are in Dallas. Long-time researcher Gus Russo, author of the recently released book Live By the Sword has an interesting story to tell about his own personal commitment to the case, and his changing views about who killed JFK, and his changing views of John and Robert Kennedy , excerpted from his book. Canadian Peter Whitmey is a conspiracy-oriented researcher who sometimes takes issue with conspiracy arguments and witnesses. His articles on this site deal with issues such as a possibly sinister conversation overheard in a Winnipeg airport , a little-known New Orleans figure named Clem H. Sehrt , an interesting connection between Oswald biographer Priscilla McMillan and a rather suspect New Orleans witness named Ron Lewis and the phone records of David Ferrie , accused plotter. Another essay outlines what Whitmey considers "Deception and Deceit" in the media in reporting the assassination. Finally, a long essay of his titled "Creating a Patsy" brings his research up to date as of the release of the Vincent Bugliosi book. Gerald Posner and his book Case Closed have come under heavy attack from the community of conspiracy-oriented "researchers." In "Defending Posner" Michael Russ compares what the conspiracy buffs say Posner said to what Posner actually said. It seems buffs are no more accurate when attacking their enemies than when discussing the assassination. Michael Beck was once a JFK "buff" -- a believer in a Kennedy assassination conspiracy. He now believes that Oswald did it all my himself. How did his beliefs change? This is his personal account of an intellectual odyssey . Researcher David Perry has been "doing" the assassination for several years, and has seen a continual stream of "revelations" come and go. In his essay "A Few Good Men" he discusses publicity-seeking, and particularly the Loy Factor story. Tony Marsh's essay "Circumstantial Evidence of a Head Shot From The Grassy Knoll" is now available online. Based on careful analysis of the movements of the occupants of the presidential limo, of the HSCA acoustic evidence, and of a "jiggle analysis" of the Zapruder film, it represents a bold and interesting attempt to put the evidence together in a compelling way. It was originally presented at the 1993 Third Decade Conference. Just how many different people have been accused of being (or have confessed to being) either a shooter or an accomplice in Dealey Plaza? Researcher David Perry has compiled the most complete known list. His Rashomon to the Extreme! is that list. Of the 68 people on this list, at least one is guilty. The essay, A Conspiracy Too Big by Fred Litwin asks about the credibility of any theory that holds that a conspiracy faked all the evidence that conspiracy theorists say is faked. John Locke's FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) outlines the evidence, from the perspective of a person who believes Oswald did it alone. A good briefing for someone who has only read conspiracy books, and wants the other side of the story. A Bad Case of Deja Vu , another essay by John Locke, compares the O.J. Simpson defense to conspiracy thinking in the Kennedy assassination. Would the intellectual habits of the conspiracy buffs have let O.J. go free? Locke says "yes."

Kennedy Assassination Internet Newsgroup: alt.assassination.jfk Newsgroup: alt.assassination.jfk A newsgroup is the Internet version of the computer “bulletin board” of the 1980’s. People leave messages, and other people respond to them. The newsgroup alt.assassination.jfk is a “moderated” newsgroup. Stuff that is off-topic (messages headed “Make Money Now!”), nasty comments (“flames” in the lingo of the ‘net), and messages posted to ten or twenty newsgroups (“spams”) are not allowed. What is allowed is discussion of the assassination, from any perspective. The newsgroup charter has more details. There is no requirement that people posting be “serious” researchers. High school students writing papers, people who just read one book and want to know whether it is accurate or not, and people who haven’t even done that — and want advice on what books to read — are all welcome. There are serious researchers on the newsgroup, however, including assassination web page authors, people who have published articles and books on the assassination, and people who teach college courses in the assassination. And there are both a good number of people who believe that there was a conspiracy, and who believe that Oswald did it all by himself. There are several ways of getting the group: Read the group from the Newsguy news service. With just your web browser, you can read the newsgroup, and post messages.

JFK Assassination Web Sites A Conspiracy? J ust as conspiracy books have been more popular than books supporting the Warren Commission conclusions, there are more conspiracy-oriented web sites than lone-nut oriented web sites. While many web sites have some Kennedy assassination material, the following specialize in the subject. This is a somewhat selective list of sites, emphasizing those with the strongest collections of resources. The Texas Monthly's Dealey Plaza Revisited is a fine balanced introduction to the issues surrounding the assassination from a journal that has become a mainstay of Texas journalism. The Mary Ferrell Foundation is named in honor of highly respected long-time Dallas area researcher Mary Ferrell, and contains a broad range of resources including essays (mostly conspiracy oriented), photos and (most important) a massive collection of primary source documents. The National Archives' Kennedy Assassination Records Collection has a search engine that allows locating documents in the Archives' massive holdings. This makes it easy to order relevant documents from the Archives. And indeed, simply knowing what documents the government has can be important information. Give the Feds some credit: this is a fine resource. The JFK Lancer site is a fine source for ordering various materials on the assassination, and it contains selected articles from The Assassination Chronicles , as well as a good selection of links to other JFK-oriented sites. JFK Online has several interesting essays (on Ruby, Silvia Odio, Jean Hill), a good links page, good brief reviews of all the major assassination books, and an excellent collection of unedited statements from assassination witnesses. It's signal strong point, however, is a very large collection of resources on Jim Garrison and Garrison's New Orleans "investigation" into the murder. Mike Russ' John F. Kennedy Assassination Information Center is strong on witness testimony, and has the invaluable technical reports of the House Select Committee on Assassinations which address issues such as the nature of Kennedy's wounds and the authenticity of the Backyard Photos. Max Holland's Washington DeCoded shows the work of a journalist intimately familiar with the history of the 60s and of the ways Washington politics impinged upon and affected how the assassination was viewed and how it was dealt with. The site 22 November 1963 is an overview of the assassination from a conspiracy perspective. Consider it a good primer on conspiracy arguments, and make a point of looking at counter-arguments on other sites. Ralph Schuster's John F. Kennedy Assassination Homepage , from Germany, is further evidence of world-wide interest in the assassination. Schuster has has a rich variety of offerings, including the Warren Commission Report, Jim Marrs' "Convenient Deaths" list, Walt Brown's index to assassination books, and extensive witness testimonies. The Real Issues Home Page , shows Mike Griffith, the page's author, to be a diligent reader of conspiracy books and a prolific writer. You can find about any aspect of the case interpreted from a conspiracy perspective here. John Simkin's Spartacus Educational site has in common with Mike Griffith's site (above) a dilligent webmaster who has put a lot of information (and, unfortunately, pseudoinformation) online. But where Griffith's site is deep, going into issues in great detail, Simkin's site is broad, providing some information on a vast number of suspects, witnesses, and even researchers. Dale Myers' JFK Files web site shows Myers' computer modelling of the shooting in Dealey Plaza, as well as material about the Tippit shooting. Myers also critiques, from a lone assassin perspective, various of the claims of conspiracists. The Academic JFK Assassination Site reflects a course on the JFK assassination taught by Kenneth A. Rahn at the University of Rhode Island. His web site is not just his syllabus, but rather a wide-ranging collection of materials. Especially interesting are sections on critical thinking, information on Warren Commission critics and collections of materials from researchers such as Tony Marsh and Peter Whitmey. Lisa Pease' Real History Archives gives you a dose of the really extreme conspiracy view. Pease believes that a very large conspiracy murdered Kennedy, and continues to cover up the crime. She includes the mainstream media, much of academia, many conspiracy authors, all authors who believe Oswald did it alone, and virtually all the posters on USENET newsgroups who don't believe in a conspiracy in her cast of sinister people. For a scary reminder of where this sort of thinking leads, click here for Lisa Pease' page on the Oklahoma City bombing . Now removed from her site, she displayed it for over two years. The site Kennedy and King (formerly Probe Magazine) is a project of James DiEugenio, a supporter of Jim Garrison and believer in a wide-ranging conspiracy that killed Kennedy and continues to cover up the murder. David Von Pein has been all over the Internet of late, capably arguing for the lone assassin viewpoint. His blog, The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy: A Lone-Gunman Viewpoint has a lot of resources, including especially video resources. The Assassination Web is a source for COPA information, COPA videos, and the world's most extensive collection of essays purporting to debunk Gerald Posner's book Case Closed . W. Tracy Parnell is a lone assassin theorist whose Lee Harvey Oswald Research Page has several valuable resources. Parnell is the chief Internet debunker of "two Oswalds" theories. Parnell's more recent research can be found on his blog W. Tracy Parnell . He continues to debunk "two Oswalds" theories, which continue to resurface in various permutations. David Perry, a crackerjack researcher who has debunked many of the stories conspiracy books repeat (although he in fact believes there was a conspiracy), has the John F. Kennedy Assassination Pages where you can learn about him and read several of his articles. Clintbradford.com has a fine collection of files covering many aspects of the assassination. The site grew out of Clint Bradford's ATD BBS (now defunct), and is resource-rich. John Masland's The Nook is a site of interest to people who want to do some real digging, featuring large databases of Warren Commission Documents, Warren Commission Witnesses, selected portions of the Warren Report, and a collection of video sound bites. Not especially recommended for the casual web "surfer," this site will be a huge boon to the serious researcher. Tony Marsh's website, The Puzzle Palace , has one thing going for it: Marsh himself, a quirky, independent-minded and innovative researcher capable of occasional near-brilliant work. Dr. Chad Zimmerman is a chiropractor who has leveraged his knowledge of anatomy to produce the JFK Assassination Research Page , which deals with various medical and ballistics issues. Fair Play was formerly an online magazine put together by John Kelin. Seldom updated now, the site's archives nonetheless has a wide variety of materials of interest. Although it often seemed to support some of the most unreliable witnesses (Roger Craig, Perry Raymond Russo), it has also debunked conspiracy fables. An important feature is Joe Backes' detailed accounts of document releases from the Assassination Records Review Board. The pioneering JFK assassination page. Visit my own Best of Assassination Sites page for a list of the offerings — chosen from the sites listed here — that I consider to be outstanding. This page is not exactly a listing of the best sites, but rather of the best resources. The following sites lack the depth of resources of the sites listed above, but all have something that the average assassination buff would want to see: Howard Willens is a former Warren Commission Counsel and strong defender of the Commission. His website is about the assassination, the Kennedys, and 60s and various other topics . The Kennedy Detail is a site devoted to the Secret Service agents who protected the president. Not pushing a conspiracy theory (nor any other theory) it holds considerable interest for assassination buffs. Julie Jackson is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Jack Franzen, Dealey Plaza witnesses who were on the south side of Elm Street a few yards from the presidential limo when Kennedy's head exploded. Her web site features her father's testimony — an invaluable historical document. Denis Morissette's web page avoids interpretation and is strong on sources — his own interviews with witnesses, government documents, and early news accounts. It's fascinating and informative. The Cuban Information Archives is a project of researcher Gordon Winslow. Winslow's work is very specialized: he only studies the Cubans — mostly anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Florida. And his research is highly reliable. Assassination buffs debate endlessly the quality of Oswald's rifle, the ability of a shooter to equal Oswald's "shooting feat" and so on. So "A Carcano Homepage" is a fine resource. It separates myth from fact in discussion of the rifle that Oswald bought from Klein's Sporting Goods — and even gives advice on how you might buy one like it! The Smoking Gun is a large, fascinating site with a corner dedicated to JFK assassination documents. Grover B. Proctor, Jr is an academic and conspiracy theorist whose website contains several interesting articles . The JFK Assassination Conspiracy Soundboard has some interesting audio clips of the media coverage of the assassination. The Sixth Floor Museum in Dallas has a web page. It has museum hours, admission, and order blanks for some of the Museum's educational materials. A recently-added feature is oral-history interviews. Larry Charbonneau's JFK Page has some good graphic images, and a variety of other interesting files. Related Web Pages? Is the Kennedy assassination a "cultist" topic? Do the people with an intense interest in the assassination display the same intellectual habits as those interested in other "crackpot" phenomena? You might examine, for example, The Bermuda Triangle Web Page. Does the logic and use of evidence in the Bermuda Triangle literature remind you of the conspiracy literature? Likewise, the UFO Skeptics Toolkit raises the same question in the context of supposed aliens from elsewhere in the Universe. Does the rhetoric about a government "coverup" sound familiar? The notion that NASA faked the landing of astronauts on the moon has had a bit of a revival lately. But the arguments are as silly as ever. Philip Plait's Bad Astronomy web site brings a dose of level-headed scientific thinking to this theory. The events of 9/11 have of course created a whole raft of conspiracy theories. One of them is from Jim Fetzer, a man well known for his Kennedy assassination books. Fetzer's page 9/11 Web Sites supports his view that no Boeing 757 hit the Pentagon, but rather a cruise missile did. Ironically, conspiracist Mike Griffith (see above) takes issue with claims like this, and provides a fine set of links titled "Refuting the 9/11 Conspiracy Theories." Is Christianity just a big conspiracy? That's the theme of Dan Brown’s popular novel The Da Vinci Code . But as history the book is wild and wacky, on a par with the most bizarre conspiracy theories. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has a web site debunking The Da Vinci Code. And don't say: "well of course they would do that." Say of Dan Brown: "well of course an author hostile toward religion and wanting to make a killing would write such a book." Return to Kennedy Assassination Home Page

Best of Kennedy Assassination Web Sites W e know that there is a lot of junk on the web, and a lot of other stuff that's just "OK." Sometimes, however, there is something unusual, peculiarly valuable, or especially informative out there. The following are my picks of material on other JFK assassination sites. This is far from being all that is good and informative, but it's what stands out as special . Click on Logo to Go to Site Home Page T he National Archives in College Park Maryland has a listing of House Select Committee documents online, and able to be searched . An absolutely invaluable resource. D ebbie Conway's JFK Lancer page has Jim Garrison's Playboy Magazine interview . It provides quite a lot of insight about the man. As an interesting exercise, count the number of different shooters he believes were in Dealey Plaza firing at Kennedy. R eal historical research is done from "primary sources" — the original documents, transcripts, testimony and so on that are the earliest and closest reflection of the historical event. People who want to study the Jim Garrison investigation, glamorized by the treatment it received in Oliver Stone's film "JFK" are immensely lucky that researcher Dave Reitzes has an ongoing interest in — indeed, almost an obsession with — the topic. His "Perpetual Pages" web site has an impressive collection of primary sources on Garrison , as well as the trial transcript of the Clay Shaw trial in New Orleans . T here is a huge fascination to listening to and viewing the way the assassination was reported in the media, and David Von Pein has assembled an impressive collection of video and audio resources allowing one to do just that. These are invaluable primary sources, often recording the early uncontaminated testimony of witnesses, but also showing some bizarre and often hilarious journalistic blunders. Before Von Pein's stellar archival effort, these were what librarians call "fugitive sources:" scattered, hard to find, usually in the hands of private collectors, not catalogued nor documented anywhere. Now they are just a mouse click away from anybody who is interested. A mong the many suspect "witnesses" who have turned up making explosive claims about events surrounding the assassination is one Antonio Veciana, who was claimed to tie Lee Harvey Oswald to CIA officer David Atlee Phillips. But as research from Tracy Parnell shows, Veciana could hardly be less credible. T he "History Matters" contains a variety of good resources, but the one that really shines is a massive collection of primary source government reports, documents, and testimony . Whether it's a Warren Commission document, or an interview by the ARRB with an autopsy witness, you are likely to find it here. S o many of the arguments and theories about the assassination turn on photographic evidence. A lot of bad theories are the result of misinterpreted photographic evidence, but sometimes photographic evidence nails some critical issues. Robin Unger has put together a splendid collection of images that you will sometimes find useful for serious research, and at other times find simply irrestable for browsing. T his site from former Washington Post reporter Jeff Morley is quite valuable for keeping up with what's going on in the world of JFK conspiracy (and lone assassin) theorizing. A blog, it is regularly updated, and deserves to be regularly visited. Morley leans in a conspiracist direction, but doesn't embrace any particular claims about who killed Kennedy, and he can be critical of half-baked theories. A lot of JFK assassination authors promise startling new relevations about the assassination, but they virtually always turn out to be thin gruel. This site, run by respected journalist Max Holland, does provide new information about the politics that surrounded and impinged upon the assassination and its aftermath. Any startling relevations here? Not really, since Holland paints a picture of government much like that of sober historians and sophisticated observers. Which is to say, it has the ring of truth. T he place to start your assassination reading is the recommended books page on this site . But suppose you are hooked? Suppose you want to go further? David Von Pein has assembled a rather comprehensive bibliographic resource listing a very large number of books and videos about the assassination. But there is more. Even if you aren't a hard core assassination buff, you may find the listed books on the Kennedy family and the historical era during which Kennedy was president of considerable interest. I t's a delicious irony, and more than a little goofy. The conspiracists are beginning to insist that the Zapruder film — for 25 years held up as proof of a conspiracy — has been tampered with to support the notion that Oswald was the sole assassin. There are, however, a fair number of sensible conspiracy-oriented people who dispute this. Among them is Clint Bradford, who has (1.) an excellent page of commentary and critique and (2.) the Zavada Report online . The Zavada report is the definitive examination of the film done by a top Kodak scientist. A lso among the conspiracists disputing Zapruder film alteration is ideosyncratic independent-minded Somerville, Massachusetts researcher Tony Marsh. Two essays by Marsh debunk this new tampering "research." One deals with the way in which conspiracy researchers have twisted witness testimony in Dealey Plaza to claim that the presidential limo stopped on Elm Street. Another analyzes arcane but important data — the images in the sprocket holes of the Zapruder film — to prove that it could not have been faked. A s you might imagine, Dallas city government has a large collection of source documents relating to the assassination. Putting them all online sounds like a Herculean task, but it has been accomplished by the Office of the City Secretary. The result is a bit of a hodge-podge, and lacks a good search engine, but the temptation to browse through this collection should prove irresistible. T his splendid site, named in honor of highly respected long-time Dallas area researcher Mary Ferrell, contains a broad range of resources. Two particularly appeal to us. First, a collection of assassination photographs which includes newly scanned copies of Warren Commission and House Select Commission photos of much higher quality than any heretofore available. But even more important, there is a database of assassination documents that is a vastly valuable resource. Full access with search capabilities requires a paid membership -- well worth it for any serious researcher. S ome of the best work debunking conspiracy fables has been done by conspiracy-oriented researchers. And why not? If there was a conspiracy, every additional boneheaded piece of "conspiracy evidence" makes it harder to discover. This essay , from the archives of John Kelin's Fair Play web site, debunks the tales of a certain Norman Similas, a photographer who claims to have been in Dealey Plaza when Kennedy was shot. M ike Russ' site features both the authoritative House Select Committee treatments of the scientific evidence in the case, and a large collection of primary source witness testimony .

Recommended Books On the Kennedy (JFK) Assassination Who Killed Kennedy? Recommended JFK Assassination Books Y ou probably enjoy this wiz-bang web technology, or you wouldn't be here. But the web is nowhere near making obsolete that old fashioned form of information technology: the printed word. Below is a list of books I recommend to people who are just getting started studying the assassination. In putting together this list, I've used the following rules: The list is ordered from the most general to the most specific. If you've read nothing, the books at the top of the list will give you an overview of what the issues are. These aren't necessarily the "best books" on the assassination. Some of them are rather bad books — but books you will want to read to get all sides of the arguments. There is a rough balance between conspiracy books and lone assassin books. You could read books on just one side of the debate, but why would you want to? This is far from all the JFK assassination books worth reading. If you want to dig very deeply into the literature about the assassination, you can find a much more comprehensive bibliography here . All the books on the list are in print as of this writing. That means that many excellent books aren't on the list. But keep your eyes open — at garage sales, used book shops and at your local library — for the following titles: Josiah Thompson — Six Seconds in Dallas Priscilla McMillan — Marina and Lee Jean Davison — Oswald's Game David Lifton — Best Evidence Warren Commission Report Don't be put off by the fact that the conspiracy types bash the Commission's work, nor by the fact that this is a government report. It reads better than you would ever expect a government report to read. It has some marked weaknesses and it can't deal with conspiracy arguments raised in the years since it was issued. But it has some signal strengths too. Click here to purchase. Crossfire Jim Marrs . The virtue of this volume is its comprehensiveness. Marrs seems never to have met a crackpot witness he didn't believe nor run across a conspiracy factoid he didn't accept. You'll get the full case for "conspiracy" here, the good, the bad, and the downright wacky. Click here to purchase. Case Closed Gerald Posner . A comprehensive "lone assassin" synthesis, and massive debunking of conspiracy factoids. Its real strength is a compelling portrait of Lee Harvey Oswald the man. Click here to purchase. The Killing of a President Robert Groden . The text is a mish-mash of conspiracy factoids, but the pictures are a treasure in this large-format volume. Click here to purchase. JFK Assassination Logic John McAdams . From the webmaster of this site, it's subtitled "How to Think About Claims of Conspiracy." This is not a book about what to think about conspiracy theories, but how to think about conspiracy theories. Mostly, it demolishes claims of conspiracy books, but it also has some guidelines for distinguishing conspiracy theories that are merely wacky from those that have a bit of plausibility. Click here to purchase. Reclaiming History Vincent Bugliosi . This massive volume debunks the claims of conspiracists right down to the most trivial seeming (but large to the conspiracist mind) details. Read it when you have been exposed to a huge number of conspiracy factoids, and are ready to see them shot to hell. Click here to purchase. Not In Your Lifetime Anthony Summers . Summers is an honest and open-minded researcher who unfortunately is too easily bamboozled by suspect witnesses with "interesting" stories to tell. The book's strength is New Orleans and Oswald's 1963 summer there. Click here to purchase. Assassination Chronicles Edward Jay Epstein . Actually three books (1) Inquest , Epstein's early critique of the work of the Warren Commission (2) Legend , a biography of Lee Oswald, and (3) Counterplot , a fine account of the Garrison investigation. Click here to purchase. High Treason Harrison Livingstone and Robert Groden . A good introduction to the conspiracy view of the medical evidence, and much more besides. Rife with inaccuracies and wacky assertions, but fascinating too. Click here to purchase. Deep Politics and the Death of JFK Peter Dale Scott . Not so much a book about the assassination as about everything else going on in American politics. In Scott's view, almost everybody was corrupt, and almost everybody probably had a role in the assassination. Click here to purchase. Jack Ruby Garry Wills and Ovid Demaris . Well-written account, anchored in extensive witness interviews, on Jack Ruby the man, Jack Ruby the murder case, Dallas the city — and Dallas the state of mind. The real Jack Ruby was nothing like the cardboard character of the conspiracy books. Click here to purchase. Cover-Up Stewart Galanor . A brief and relatively sensible presentation of the case for conspiracy. Pretty mainstream, avoiding the wilder stuff that Jim Marrs (above) includes. Has a good photo section. Click here to purchase. Pictures of the Pain Richard Trask . Nominally only deals with the photographers who photographed the assassination and aftermath, and their photos. In reality a detailed, accurate, and compelling account of what happened "on the ground" in Dallas and especially in Dealey Plaza that day. Click here to purchase. False Witness Patricia Lambert . The definitive debunking of the Garrison investigation, based on the full documentary record (much of it recently released) and extensive witness interviews. Shows the real Jim Garrison. Click here to purchase. Who's Who in the JFK Assassination Michael Benson . A comprehensive tome with entries for everybody you have heard of in connection with the assassination, and many you haven't. Uncritically accepts the stuff in badly-researched conspiracy books. Think of it as the Encyclopedia of Assassination Factoids , and you'll appreciate its usefulness. Click here to purchase. With Malice Dale Myers . This book may be more than you wanted to know about the Tippit murder, but here it all is in great detail and fine scholarship. Click here to purchase. Looking for something else?

An article by the Board's Chairman, John Tunheim , provides a retrospective on the Board's work, which ended in September of 1998, and the Review Board's Final Report provides a more detailed summary of the Board's accomplishments. Introduction The Assassination Records Review Board is an independent federal agency created to oversee the identification and release of records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The Review Board was established by the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection act of 1992 (PL 102-526), and was signed into law by George Bush. The five members of the Board were appointed by President Clinton, confirmed by the United States Senate, and sworn in on April 11, 1994. The law gives the Assassination Records Review Board the mandate and the authority to identify, secure, and make available all records related to the assassination of President Kennedy. The board has until October 1, 1996 to fulfill its mandate, plus an additional year at the Board's discretion to complete its responsibilities. The Review Board Members The Honorable John R. Tunheim; Chair; United States District Court Judge; District of Minnesota. Dr. Henry F. Graff; Professor Emeritus of History at Columbia University. Dr. Kermit L. Hall; Dean, College of Humanities, and Professor of History and Law at The Ohio State University. Dr. William L. Joyce; Associate University Librarian for Rare Books and Special Collections at Princeton University. Dr. Anna K. Nelson; Adjunct Professor of History at The American University. The Law The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act was enacted by the Congress and signed into law by President George Bush on October 26, 1992. The law states, "All government records concerning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy should carry a presumption of immediate disclosure." The law mandates that all assassination-related materials be house in a single collection in the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The Act defines five categories of information for which disclosure may be postponed, including national security, intelligence gathering, and privacy--provided there is "clear and convincing evidence" of some harm which outweighs public disclosure. The law requires all federal agencies to make an initial assessment of whether they possess records relating to the assassination. The agencies themselves will conduct an initial review to determine whether their records may be disclosed immediately, or whether disclosure should be postponed. They agencies must then give all records that are not disclosed to the Review Board. The Review Board will then evaluate all agency decisions to postpone the release of records. Once the Board completes its review of an agency's recommendation for postponement, all records, including those that have a postponed release date, will be transferred to NARA. The Act requires that all assassination records must be opened by 2017, with the exception of records certified for continued postponement by the President. Authority of the Assassination Records Review Board The Senate report of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection act of 1992 stated that "the underlying principles guiding the legislation are independence, public confidence, efficiency, and cost effectiveness." In order to achieve these objectives, the Act gave the board the specific powers to: - direct government offices to provide identification aids and organize assassination records; - direct government offices to transmit assassination records to the National Archives; - obtain assassination records that have been identified and organized by a government office; - direct government offices to investigate the facts, additional information, records, or testimony from individuals which the Board has reason to believe is required; - request the Attorney general to subpoena private persons to compel testimony, records and other relevant information; - require any government office in writing for the destruction of any records relating to the assassination of President Kennedy; - receive information from the public regarding the identification and public disclosure of assassination records; and - hold hearings, administer oaths, and subpoena witnesses and documents. Background and Need for the Law On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated while traveling in a motorcade in Dallas, Texas. His tragic death, and the subsequent murder of Lee Harvey Oswald, the president's alleged assassin, led to the creation of the Warren Commission, seven days after the assassination. Amid continuing public doubts that all of the facts surrounding the assassination had not come to light, the House of Representatives established the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1976 to reopen the investigation. In addition to these two major federal investigations devoted to the investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy, three other federal investigatory bodies have dealt with the assassination to some degree. President Ford created The Rockefeller Commission in 1975 to investigate Central Intelligence Agency activities within the United states. Part of the Commission's efforts related to the Kennedy assassination. Also in 1975, Congress created the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (the Church Committee) and the House Select Committee on Intelligence (the Pike Committee). Some of the work of these committees was related to the assassination. Despite these official investigations, and with private researchers continuing their efforts, the public was not satisfied that all of their questions about the assassination of President Kennedy had been answered. The result was the passage of The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, which included the creation of the Assassination Records Review Board. Accomplishments of the Review Board Through October, 1996, the Review Board had acted to transfer nearly 10,000 to the National Archives and Records Administration for inclusion in the JFK Collection. At the end of 1996, that collection totaled approximately 3.1 million pages. Government Records Related to the Assassination -- By the end of 1997, the Review board will have reviewed and processed nearly all of the assassination records that have been identified by federal agencies, with the important exceptions of the FBI and CIA. The overwhelming majority of previously redacted information will have been made public. These Records Include: - Thousands of CIA documents on Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassination of President Kennedy that make up the CIA's Oswald File - Thousands of once-secret records from the investigation of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, including the controversial Staff Report on Oswald and Mexico City. - Thousands of records from the FBI's core and related assassination files Private and Local Records -- The Board has identified and secured significant assassination-related records in the hands of private citizens and local government, including copies of the official records of District Attorney Jim Garrison's investigation of the assassination, the personal papers of Warren Commission Chief Counsel J. Lee Rankin, as well as long-lost films taken in Dallas on November 22, 1963 that the public had never seen. The Job Ahead Sequestered Collections -- Additional time will permit the Board to complete its review of the huge and critically important collections of records at the CIA and FBI that were requested by the HSCA in the course of their investigation. The Records of Some Agencies and Congressional Committees -- Additional time will allow the Board to finish its work with several agencies and Congressional committees (NSA, Secret Service, Senate Intelligence Committee). Search for Additional Records -- Additional time will permit the Board's search for additional records held by government agencies, private individuals, and local governments to be concluded with greater confidence. Some of these records have been identified, but not yet acquired by the Board. Foreign Records -- The Board has started the process of collecting and reviewing records held by a number of foreign countries (Russia, Belarus, Mexico, England, Germany, France, Japan. Cuba). Contact has been made with several countries. Additional time will increase the likelihood of success.

Gordon Arnold claims to have been on the Grassy Knoll during the JFK assassination Gordon Arnold in 1988 You’ve heard, perhaps, of the Umbrella Man, Black Dog Man, and Badge Man; but are you familiar with . . . Nowhere Man: The Strange Story of Gordon Arnold by Dave Reitzes I n the days, weeks, months, and even years following President Kennedy’s tragic murder in Dallas, a number of individuals not initially identified as witnesses have come forward to bestow such status upon themselves. Some sound reasonable enough and are widely accepted as genuine eyewitnesses, even if their accounts add little to our understanding of that day’s events; others make claims that can be harder to accept as authentic. As author Richard Trask has observed: There are numerous examples of various fakers, publicity seekers, and mentally imbalanced individuals who unfortunately often present themselves after the fact as legitimate spectators or even participants to history. With the development of rapid transportation and speedy communications, individuals can be at locations soon after a breaking news event or can at least quickly learn information about such events. In extreme cases one could fabricate a story, enabling him to fool others with passable knowledge of what actual witnesses did see. The desire to be a part of exciting or historic events or to acquire a sense of importance can motivate people to say things that aren’t true. Sometimes this may manifest itself in relatively innocent acts of exaggeration, as may be the case with statements Dallas Morning News reporter Hugh Aynesworth heard in the chaotic moments that followed the shooting of President Kennedy. Aynesworth, who himself was an eyewitness to the assassination, began talking to other witnesses immediately, scribbling down notes on the backs of some envelopes he happened to have with him. He recalls: I remember interviewing people that said they saw certain things; some did, some didn’t. Even then there were people making up things. Even then! I remember interviewing a young couple where the guy was telling me that he had seen this and he had seen that, and his wife said, “You didn’t see that! We were back in the parking lot when it happened!” Even then! And, of course, we’ve seen that in abundance since. In rare instances, of course, people may indulge in behavior that fulfills the definition of a full-blown hoax. Sensational photographs vanish? One of the first cases of this type to emerge in the wake of the Kennedy assassination is that of photographer Norman Similas, a 34-year-old resident of Ontario, Toronto, who was in Dallas on the day of the assassination, covering the annual American Bottlers’ Carbonated Beverages convention for the Canadian Beverage Review . Almost immediately Similas began claiming to have “witnessed from a distance of less than seven feet the assassination of President Kennedy” (“close enough to the car to have kicked the side of it”), from the south side of Elm Street, a “spot not far from the underpass.” His account included any number of implausible elements, including the claim that during the shooting, a Secret Service agent ran up to the President’s limousine, gun drawn, and opened the door, sending JFK “falling toward the pavement.” Similas also claimed to have obtained sensational photographs of the assassination, including a shot of the sixth-floor “Sniper’s Nest” window of the Texas School Book Depository with two people visible inside, one of whom had been caught in the act of firing a rifle. Inspection of Similas’s photographs failed to bear out such claims; in fact, while he had obtained numerous shots of crowd-lined streets and possibly portions of the motorcade, none of his photos showed any evidence of having been taken in Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination. Similas later claimed that his most important photos were unaccountably missing, but newsmen who interviewed him described him as evasive and unbelievable. One of these men, Associated Press day photo editor Ray Jefferies, who studied Similas’s negatives and interviewed him the day after the assassination, commented that Similas “probably cooked up the story to make a fast buck.” A thorough investigation led authorities to agree. An unseen motion picture of the assassination? In the wee hours of March 24, 1964, Duty Sergeant Patrick T. Dean received a collect call from Victoria, British Columbia, from a man who identified himself as Ralph Simpson. Simpson claimed to have been vacationing in Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination and to have filmed the assassination from a vantage point that captured the Texas School Book Depository in the background. It was quickly determined that “Simpson” was actually one Ralph Henry William Smele, who admitted to Canadian authorities that he had never been to Dallas, had never had any film of the assassination, and had made the phone call to Dallas while watching television and drinking. Sinister doings on the grassy knoll? Another such episode began on December 5, 1966, when the Dallas Police Department received a long-distance telephone call from an individual identifying himself as Wilfred Baetz of New York City. In a letter of December 7 to the Dallas FBI, Police Chief Charles Batchelor reported that Baetz stated that on November 22, 1963, at the time of the assassination of President Kennedy, he was standing on the grass on the north side of Elm Street — on the slope approaching the triple underpass. He recalls only one shot and that immediately after the shot he ran up the slope toward the railroad tracks and was stopped by an unknown police officer who pointed a pistol at him and shouted, “Where are you going?” He then returned down the slope. [He] stated that he could hear very little out of his left ear and that he heard the shot with his right ear and in his opinion the shot came from his right which was the direction of the railroad tracks. He also stated that he saw a puff of smoke come from behind the fence near the railroad tracks. He stated he was so excited he doesn’t recall any additional shots. He further stated that at the time of the incident, he did not reveal himself and had talked to no one regarding this until the recent publicity. He states that he revealed himself and made a statement to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York City. Although Baetz had not contacted the New York City FBI, as claimed, the FBI investigated and identified Wilfred H. Baetz as a Bronxville, New York, resident with a colorful past. Born in Darby, England, on February 13, 1911, Wilfred Henry Baetz had, by his own account, lived in the United States since childhood. He had served in the U.S. Army in 1941-42 and subsequently received a medical discharge. He had once enjoyed a career as a radio scriptwriter and singer. In 1943, Baetz had been responsible for composing such patriotic ditties as “Stand By America” and “You Buy ‘Em We’ll Fly ‘Em.” Before the war’s end, however, life for Baetz took a darker turn, as he embarked upon an arson spree that spanned at least seven years, resulted in several prison terms and at least one commitment to a mental hospital for observation, and was estimated by Boston police to have been responsible for “25 to 30 fires in Brookline, Allston and Brighton, Massachusetts.” Contacted by the FBI on December 21, 1966, Baetz admitted to his arson record, as well as “a couple of drunk arrests in Brighton, and Boston, Massachusetts.” He stated that he had maintained no steady employment since suffering a heart attack two years earlier, had no children, and lived with his wife, Caroline, who was employed by the Time-Life Company. Researcher Debra Conway theorizes that Baetz’s call to Dallas was triggered by a reading of the November 25, 1966, issue of Life magazine, which featured prominent coverage of the assassination’s anniversary (possibly the “recent publicity” Baetz referred to in his phone call) and reports of evidence pointing to a possible grassy knoll gunman. However, while it was confirmed that a twelve-minute call to the Dallas Police Department had been charged from Baetz’s home phone number, Baetz denied placing the phone call to the Dallas Police Department. He told the FBI that “on November 22, 1963, the date of President Kennedy’s assassination, he and his wife and his sister-in-law were at his residence and watched the details of the assassination on television. He stated that he was practically ‘glued’ to his television set for the next three days.” He added that “he knows nothing concerning the assassination of President Kennedy other than what he has observed on television or read about,” and suggested that someone must have charged the call to his home telephone as some kind of practical joke. Another film of the assassination goes missing? On December 5, 1963, a woman who refused to give her name phoned the Detroit office of the FBI and claimed that “she had taken 16 millimeter colored movies of the assassination” of President Kennedy, and that “these movies had turned out better than the pictures published in ‘Life’ magazine [from the Abraham Zapruder home movie].” She said she would “mail these movies” to the FBI’s Detroit office. An FBI report notes, “This woman advised that she was a graduate student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, working towards a Ph.D. degree. She said she is a State Department exchange student from West Berlin, Germany, and said that she was then leaving immediately for Germany. This unidentified woman also stated that she had a sister in Dallas that she had been visiting at the time of the assassination.” The FBI attempted to identify and locate the woman with the assistance of the International Institute of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and the Detroit office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, without success. The same day the FBI received the anonymous phone call, a similar call was received by Robert Lubeck, Feature Editor of the Detroit News . The caller identified herself only as a “Mrs. Beck,” who said she was from Lincoln Park, Michigan, and a subscriber to the Detroit News. She said she had some 16 millimeter color “films of the assassination” taken from the overpass in Dealey Plaza, “which were better than the ones in ‘Life’ magazine.” She said she would deliver the film to the Detroit News personally. If “Mrs. Beck’s” film existed, it would have been worth hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of dollars; but neither this incentive, nor any consciousness of the potential legal and historical importance of such a film, ever motivated “Mrs. Beck” to make good on her claims. Neither the FBI nor the Detroit News ever received any such film, and “Mrs. Beck” was never heard from again. An attempt to identify the Detroit News caller through subscription records failed. According to those who witnessed the assassination from the railroad overpass, there were no women in that area. An assassination film deep-sixed by government agents? Then there is the well-known story of Beverly Oliver, who began claiming in 1970 that she had filmed the assassination, but that her film had been confiscated from her and never returned. Researchers wondered whether she could be an unidentified woman seen in numerous films and photos who appeared to be filming or photographing the presidential limousine from extremely close range. Because of the scarf tied around her head, she had become known within the research community as the “Babushka Lady.” Interviewed in 1971, Oliver “said she took a color movie at about where the ‘Babushka Lady’ was located but couldn’t pick herself out with any definiteness in . . . photos.” (Six years later, during a March 12, 1977, interview with representatives of the House Select Committee reinvestigating the assassination, Oliver was still unable to state whether or not the “Babushka Lady” in some Dealey Plaza photographs was her.) The next day, she said, she turned the “undeveloped film over to two agents who claimed to be federal, but who she said dressed like Texas Rangers.” She didn’t get their names or a receipt, and said she never saw film her film again. “From the position that I was filming, I had the best shot of the assassination, and probably the only one that had a real good shot of the grassy knoll,” Oliver would later state. “And [there] probably would be a lot of unanswered questions answered if my film could be found.” FBI, CIA, and Secret Service records disclose no information whatsoever about the existence of any such film. Oliver’s story later underwent any number of revisions, expansions, and embellishments. She initially claimed that she had filmed the assassination with a Super 8 Yashica movie camera; but the Super 8 camera was not marketed in the US until November 1965. Upon learning this Oliver began claiming that her camera had actually been an 8 mm foreign-made experimental model. In sworn testimony years later, she denied ever having identified the camera as a Yashica Super 8 model. The day her film was confiscated was revised from Saturday, November 23rd, to Sunday, November 24th, then finally to Monday, November 25th. The men “dressed like Texas Rangers” who had taken her film were later described as simply agents in plainclothes, whom she believed were either FBI or Secret Service; or as men who “showed me some cards and introduced themselves, I don’t remember their names, but they said they were from the FBI and the CIA . . .” In the late 1980s Oliver began making the startling claim that she had seen an actual shooter on the grassy knoll. “I know where I thought the shots came from was the picket fence area around that large tree,” Oliver states in the British documentary series The Men Who Killed Kennedy, “somewhere on the other side of those steps [indicating east of the steps leading to the pergola], but in the picket fence area. There was a figure there, and there was smoke there. I will always believe that the man that shot President Kennedy was standing somewhere in the picket fence area,” she adds somewhat incongruously, “and no one’ll ever convince me any differently.” This was hardly the extent of her story, however. She also claimed to have been a close personal friend of Jack Ruby: “Jack was a very precious friend of mine,” she said. “I probably knew him as well as anyone on the face of the earth.” Yet, in all the thousands of available pages of statements and testimony from hundreds of Ruby associates and acquaintances, not a single one of them, friend or foe, mentions this heartwarming friendship between the 16-year-old beauty and the 52-year-old nightclub owner. On one occasion at Ruby’s Carousel Club, Oliver reported with a straight face, Ruby introduced her to a young man he identified as his friend, “Lee Oswald of the CIA.” Oliver professed to have had a close friendship with stripper Janet Conforto, known professionally as Jada. According to Oliver: Jada had witnessed her meeting with Ruby and Oswald; she had spoken with Jada at the Carousel Club on the eve of the assassination; Jada told reporters about Oswald knowing Ruby; and the stripper soon mysteriously “disappeared.” Oliver kept silent about her story for so long, she said, because “I didn’t want to become a statistic” like Jada; “I didn’t want to become one of those people that shot myself in the back of the head with a shotgun.” Actually, Jada had not worked at the Carousel Club for nearly a month prior to the assassination . She told reporters that, as far as she knew, Oswald and Ruby did not know each other . And she did not “disappear” or die mysteriously, but rather, moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico. According to Oliver, another witness to her meeting with Jack Ruby and Lee Oswald was Carousel bartender Andrew Armstrong. Armstrong told the Warren Commission he had never seen Lee Oswald at the Carousel Club, and had never seen anyone who resembled Oswald. Years after New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison made national headlines charging a New Orleans man named David Ferrie with involvement in the assassination (but not while Garrison’s investigation into the assassination was still active), Beverly Oliver began claiming she had seen David Ferrie frequently at Jack Ruby’s Carousel Club in 1963; that she had seen him there so often, in fact, that she had believed him to be an assistant manager of the club. But David Ferrie lived and worked in New Orleans in 1963, and there is no evidence whatsoever that he made any travels to Dallas. On the contrary, Ferrie friend Layton Martens told author Gus Russo that between himself and three other friends, “one or more of us were at Dave’s apartment [with Ferrie] practically every night that year.” When Texas resident Ricky Don White came forward in 1990 to claim that his father, Roscoe, had been an assassin on the grassy knoll in Dealey Plaza, Beverly Oliver supported White’s story, “remembering” that she had seen Roscoe White on the knoll just after the shooting. The Ricky Don White story was quickly unmasked as a fraud , one of the most notorious hoaxes in the history of the assassination inquiry. Later still, Oliver began claiming to have inside knowledge of an assassination plot that she says took the life of Martin Luther King, Jr. Some common threads Though to some degree it may be coincidence, certain motifs seem to emerge in the claims made by these individuals. There are the frequent and tantalizing allusions to grassy knoll assassins; unseen photographic evidence of the assassination, sometimes described as better or more important than the extant photos and films; and, of course, references to sinister or suspicious police officers or federal agents, shielding the area behind the picket fence on the grassy knoll from prying eyes, or confiscating evidence from hapless eyewitnesses. If it is a reasonably simple matter, however, to dismiss the claims of Norman Similas, “Ralph Simpson,” Wilfred Baetz, et al, it is still an indisputable fact that dozens upon dozens of spectators near the site of the assassination were never identified or interviewed by the local or federal authorities. Sooner or later, some of these witnesses are bound to come forward. If there is no solid evidence one way or the other, how is one to know if any of these latecomers is the genuine article or not? Enter Gordon Arnold In 1978, at a time when a House of Representatives Select Committee was stirring up public interest in JFK’s murder, some members of a Dallas jury panel, during a break in proceedings, began discussing the assassination. One member of the group, Gordon Arnold, volunteered the information that he had been an eyewitness in Dealey Plaza, but had never been interviewed by the authorities. His statements were brought to the attention of newsman Earl Golz, who first reported Arnold’s tale in the Dallas Morning News of Sunday, August 27, 1978: Gordon L. Arnold, [a] former Dallas soldier, said he was stopped by a man wearing a light-colored suit as he was walking behind a fence on top of the grassy knoll minutes before the assassination. Arnold, now an investigator for the Dallas Department of Consumer Affairs, was not called by the Warren Commission and has not been interviewed by the House Assassinations Committee. Arnold said he was moving toward the railroad bridge over the triple underpass to take movie film of the presidential motorcade when “this guy just walked towards me and said that I shouldn’t be up there.” Arnold challenged the man’s authority, he said, and the man “showed me a badge and said he was with the Secret Service and that he didn’t want anybody up there.” Arnold then retreated to the front of the picket fence high up on the knoll just to the west of the pergola on the north side of Elm Street. AS THE PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE came down Elm towards the triple underpass, Arnold stood on a mound of fresh dirt and started rolling his film. He said he “felt” the first shot come from behind him, only inches over his left shoulder, he said. “I had just gotten out of basic training,” Arnold said, “In my mind live ammunition was being fired. It was being fired over my head and I hit the dirt.” Arnold, then 22, said the first two shots came from behind the fence, “close enough for me to fall down on my face.” He stayed there for the duration of the shooting. His fence position, under the shade of a tree, may have locked away his story for 15 years as the Warren Commission and later other assassination researchers scanned photographs and movie footage of Dealey Plaza for witnesses to the shooting. The first two shots that Arnold heard did not come from the Texas School Book Depository Building because “you wouldn’t hear a whiz go over the top of your head like that.” He said, “I say a whiz — you didn’t really hear a whiz of a bullet, you hear just like a shock wave. You feel it . . . You feel something and then a report comes right behind it. It’s just like the end of a muzzle blast.” He said he heard two shots, “and then there was a blend. For a single bolt action, he had to have been firing darn good because I don’t think anybody could fire that rapid a bolt action.” “The next thing I knew someone was kicking my butt and telling me to get up.” Arnold said, “it was a policeman. And I told him to go jump in the river. And then this other guy — a policeman — comes up with a shotgun and he was crying and that thing was waving back and forth. I said you can have everything I’ve got. Just point it someplace else.” ARNOLD TOOK his film from the canister and threw it to the policeman. “It wasn’t worth three dollars and something to be shot. All I wanted them to do was to take that blooming picture (film) and get out of there, just let me go. That shotgun and the guy crying over there was enough to unnerve me for anything.” Two days later, Arnold was on a plane reporting for duty at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. He hadn’t given police in Dealey Plaza his name and never told his story to authorities, “because I heard after that there were a lot of people making claims about pictures and stuff and they were dying sort of peculiarly. I just said, well, the devil with it, forget it. Besides, I couldn’t claim my pictures anyway; how did I know what were mine?” Arnold never was interviewed by the House Select Committee reinvestigating the case, but he told much the same story to author Henry Hurt in May 1982, adding, “If I could have dug a hole and crawled in, I would have, because there was more than one shot fired. It was like a crack, just like I was standing there under the muzzle. One shot went past my ear, and the other went over me.” “I thought they were shooting at me,” he said. Interviewed by Jim Marrs in 1985, Arnold related his tale again, adding that he spoke briefly with the Secret Service agent a second time (after departing the area of the railroad bridge, “I could feel he was following me and we had a few more words”), and adding further details about his encounter with the two policemen: “One of them asked me if I had taken any film and I said yes. He told me to give him my film, so I tossed him my camera. I said you can have everything, just point that gun somewhere else. He opened it, pulled out the film, and then threw the camera back to me. All I wanted to do was get out of there. The gun and the guy crying was enough to unnerve me.” Arnold is best known, however, for his appearance in Nigel Turner’s 1988 documentary series, The Men Who Killed Kennedy — the first and last time Gordon Arnold would be interviewed on film. Over footage of the former soldier walking through the parking lot behind the stockade fence, Arnold says: On that particular morning, what happened was I came downtown and I thought there was going to be a parade. So what I did, I parked my vehicle back here in this parking lot, and I intentionally walked to this particular corner because I wanted to take pictures of the parade off of the railroad bridge. Well, this is about as far as I got because what happened is when I got my leg to about this position [lifts his right leg over the steam pipe], a man came around the corner, off the bridge, had a suit on, and he turned around and told me I was not going to be there. And I guess I was younger and more spunky at that time because I told him, “You and who else is going to keep me off the bridge?” And he pulled out [an] identification card and said, “I’m with the CIA,” and I said, “Well, that’s enough muscle. I’ll leave.” So I turned around and brought my leg back over like this, I walked down the fence line here, about halfway. And I was looking over the fence to see if I could get a good shot of the parade, and he come back up and told me, he says, “I told you to get out of this area.” And I said, “Okay.” So I walked the complete length of the fence, got around on the other side. That’s when I started to line up my frames so that I could take a picture of the parade. I had been panning shots through here so that I could get whatever was going to come down the street, and I saw that it was the President of the United States. And as I was panning down in this direction, just as I got to about this position, a shot came right past my left ear, and that meant it would have had to have come from this direction. And that’s when I fell down, and to me it seemed like a second shot was at least fired over my head. There was a bunch of report [ sic ] going on in this particular area at that time. And what happened was that while I was laying on the ground, it seemed like a gentleman came from this particular direction [points behind him to the east]. And I thought it was a police officer because he had a uniform of a police officer, but he didn’t wear a hat, and he had dirty hands. But it didn’t really matter much at that time because, with him crying like he was, and with him shaking when he had the weapon in his hand, I think I’d have gave him almost anything except the camera because that was my mother’s. And literally what the man did was kick me, and asked me if I was taking a picture. I told him that I was. And when I looked at the weapon, it was about that big around, and I decided that I would let him have the film. I gave it to him, and then he went back off in this direction, I went off in this direction; three days later I was in Alaska, and I didn’t come back to the United States for about eighteen months. . . . The training that I had just finished, they were shooting live ammunition over us, and when a bullet goes past your ear and your eardrum feels like it’s coming out the other side of your head, it’s close. That’s why I thought I was shot. There’s no doubt in my mind that I was there and it did occur. Was Gordon Arnold really in Dealey Plaza? Did events occur as he described them?

The JFK Assassination Medical Evidence The Medical Evidence B ecause medical issues are often technical issues, the average reader of the average conspiracy book is likely to take the word of the author that such and such is true. Few people, after all, have the medical training to dispute what the book says. Further, the doctors who performed the autopsy, and the Warren Commission which had to reach conclusions based on the medical evidence, blundered in substantial ways. These blunders can be presented as evidence of some sinister conspiracy, rather than then result of haste and an excessive concern for the feelings of the Kennedy family. The information here, while not giving a comprehensive overview of the evidence, will at least highlight some of the common errors (and worse) that the conspiracy books make. Shooting Yourself in the Foot The Warren Commission published two rather inaccurate drawings of Kennedy’s wounds . Does this indicate a conspiracy? See what Arlen Specter told the Commission in a confidential memo. The Dallas Doctors At a news conference on the afternoon of the assassination, the doctors who attended to Kennedy in the Parkland Emergency Room discussed the President’s wounds (photo at right). Although the Parkland staff did a highly competent job of treating Kennedy and Connally, their statements about the nature of the wounds were confused, contradictory, and often mistaken. Of course, conspiracy authors have had a field day with them, claiming that the back of Kennedy’s head was blasted out, and that the bullet wound in Kennedy’s neck was one of entrance. And example of how conspiracy books use evidence selectively can be found in an account written on the day of the assassination by Dr. Marion "Pepper" Jenkins. The account says the wound was "occipital" and that "cerebellum" protruded from the wound. Both of these statements imply that the back of the head was blown out. Yet the account says the wound was to the "right side of the head" and that it was "temporal" (which means the side of the head). Guess which statements conspiracy books tell their readers about, and which they withhold? Dr. Robert Grossman has testified to being in Trauma Room One at Parkland Hospital during the futile attempt to save John Kennedy. A respected neurosurgeon, he certainly seems like the sort of witness one could rely on. Unfortunately, his testimony is problematic in many ways, as David Lifton argues in "Dr. Robert Grossman—Phantom of Trauma Room One." The Head Wound With the possible exception of the Single Bullet Theory, nothing about the assassination has been as controversial as the nature of Kennedy’s head wound. Conspiracists have stressed witness testimony that the back of Kennedy’s head was blown out, suggesting a shot from the Grassy Knoll. Lone assassin theorists have stressed the photographic evidence and the autopsy x-rays, which show the back of the head intact. The panel above shows four of the dozens of versions of Kennedy’s head wound. Which of these is closest to the truth? Randy Robertson claims to have found, in the x-rays of Kennedy’s skull, evidence of two bullet hits to Kennedy’s head. This is his statement to Rep. Conyer’s subcommittee of the U.S. Congress in November 1993. Also included is one of the reviews of his article that caused the journal Radiology to reject it, as well as a brief critique from me. Speaking of the head wound, the distribution of bullet fragments in Kennedy’s brain, as shown in the autopsy x-rays, gives a lot of information about the bullet that hit Kennedy, and (more importantly) rules out a variety of theories about the head shot. WOUND1.GIF is a drawing, from conspiracy author Charles Wilber, of the distribution of fragments. Drawn from the work of Cyril Wecht, it is quite consistent with Lattimer’s drawings in Kennedy and Lincoln . Like Wecht, John Lattimer was one of the first people to see the autopsy photos and x-rays. LATERAL.GIF is his drawing of the damage to Kennedy’s head. Compare it to the drawings in books by authors like Groden and Livingstone. The nature of Kennedy’s head wound has been a matter of continuing controversy. ANGEL1.GIF , ANGEL2.GIF , and ANGEL3.GIF are the report Dr. Lawrence Angel, a forensic anthropologist of the Smithsonian Institution, submitted to the HSCA. Particularly interesting is Angel’s drawing of the damage shown in the photos and x-rays in ANGEL3.GIF. HEAD.JPG is the famous photograph of the inside of Kennedy’s skull, with the brain removed. Conspiracy books usually print it rotated 90 degrees. Here it is right side up. Compare this photo to ANGEL3.GIF (above). Does the Harper Fragment Prove a Shot from the Grassy Knoll? The Harper Fragment was a piece of bone discovered in Dealey Plaza the day after the assassination. A Dallas doctor (A. B. Cairns) identified it as occipital bone from a human skull. Further, conspiracy books claim the fragment was found behind the location of the limo at the moment Kennedy’s head exploded. If these claims are correct, that means the back of Kennedy’s head was blown out, which would imply both a shooter in front of Kennedy and fakery in the autopsy photos and x-rays. But what does the evidence show on these points? Was the Back of Kennedy’s head Really Blown Out? See for yourself what the Zapruder film shows . Of course, conspiracy buffs are increasingly insisting that the Zapruder film has been tampered with (this is after 30 years of insisting that it is ironclad evidence of conspiracy). Then, you might ask, how do the Dealey Plaza witnesses describe the head wound. Take a look at how Zapruder described the wound to Jay Watson of WFAA-TV shortly after the assassination, and read how the wound was described by Marilyn Sitzman , who was standing next to Zapruder. Likewise, James Altgens was standing in front of and to the right of the limo at the time of the head shot. Here is the portion of his Warren Commission testimony describing the explosion of Kennedy’s head . Read this carefully, because Altgens is mistaken on a point or two. Interpreting the Head X-rays The image at right is one of the X-rays of John Kennedy taken at the Bethesda autopsy. It’s the "AP" (anterior-posterior) image of the head. Click on the image to see a larger version. This X-ray is extremely controversial, as is the corresponding lateral view of the skull. It’s supposed to show fakery of the autopsy photographs, and thus a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. It is puzzling if you don’t know how to read X-rays. But when people who do know how to read X-rays examine the films, they yield a clear picture of the wound, as explained in this essay by Joe Durnavich . Key Concept: Beveling. When a bullet penetrates the skull bone, it will leave a small hole on the side from which it enters, and a larger dished-out crater on the side that it exits. The existence of beveling of the bone of Kennedy’s skull allowed the autopsists — and later panels of forensic pathologists — to establish that the bullet that hit Kennedy in the head entered from behind, with at least one large fragment exiting toward the front. See JFK Exhibit F-61, from the House Select Committee on Assassinations. Medical Evidence on the Single Bullet Theory John Lattimer has done several experiments to determine whether the Single Bullet Theory is scientifically supportable. In the first he deals with the question: were there so many fragments in John Connally that they could not all have come from CE 399? In the second , he deals with the question: could an exit wound in the front of Kennedy’s neck look like an entrance wound? Years before Lattimer’s Kennedy and Lincoln was published, Josiah Thompson carefully scrutinized the evidence on the issue of whether the bullet fragments found in John Connally had (in total) too much mass to have come from CE 399. Here is the section of Six Seconds in Dallas dealing with this issue. Conspiracy books describe the Dallas doctors as being absolutely sure that the wound in Kennedy’s throat was an entrance wound. What they usually omit is the fact that the doctors who actually saw the wound speculated that it was an exit wound from a fragment from the head shot. They also imply that ER personnel can easily tell whether a wound is an entrance wound or an exit wound. This essay consists of two parts. The first documents the speculations of the Dallas doctors about the wound, and the second is a passage from the JAMA describing a careful study of the ability of ER personnel to make judgments about the forensic aspects of wounds. The autopsy doctors were puzzled by the fact that there was a clear entrance wound on Kennedy's upper back, but no visible exit wound. In fact, the exit wound in the throat had been obliterated by the tracheostomy done at Parkland Hospital. But years later, a Dr. Robert Livingston claimed to have called autopsist Dr. James Humes before the autopsy and told him about the exit wound in the throat. Was Humes lying about not knowing about an exit wound? In fact, Livingston's credibility is questionable, and even if he is telling the absolute truth his call would have left Humes puzzled, and not informed . Is Kennedy "Clutching At His Throat" in the Zapruder Film? Not according to Dr. John Lattimer, whose view is that Kennedy’s arms are assuming a "Thorburn position" after the Single Bullet passed near his spine. Dr. Robert Artwohl agrees that the position of Kennedy’s arms represents an involuntary neurological reaction, but doesn’t agree that it is a "Thorburn position." Click here for Artwohl’s view of the issue, originally posted as messages on the Compuserve JFK Forum. Dr. Kenneth Strully, a neurosurgeon from New Hampshire, also has addressed the issue of Kennedy’s arm movements, and also sees them as the result of a neuromuscular reaction . Telling the Truth at Long Last? T he man at right is Dr. Charles Crenshaw, who was in the Emergency Room when Kennedy was treated at Parkland Hospital. He claimed in his 1992 book Conspiracy of Silence to be finally telling the truth about the assassination — a truth he feared to tell earlier. His testimony, quite conveniently, "corroborates" what conspiracy books have been saying for years. Is he a crackpot, a profiteer, or a brave truth-teller? Click here for the "scoop." Are the Autopsy Photos Faked? In 1981, The Boston Globe had a panel of photographic experts closely examine the photos and x-rays from Kennedy’s autopsy to determine their authenticity. Bob Groden — yes, the fellow who showed up at the O.J. Simpson trial — was there making his case that they were faked. See how much success he had in convincing bona fide experts of fakery. Of course, the House Select Committee had already thoroughly examined the "forgery" issue. It commissioned the nation’s top experts to examine the autopsy materials for fakery, and here is their report . If you actually believe that Harrison Livingstone is an expert on the photos and x-rays, you need to read this. Accompanying this file is a graphic showing the face measurements forensic anthropologists used to establish that the person in the autopsy photos was John F. Kennedy. Of course, if the autopsy photos and x-rays are faked, just how many people would have to be implicated in doing — and lying about — the fakery? This essay by Joel Grant discusses the history of this issue. The autopsy doctors have always accepted the photos and x-rays as genuine. In early 1967 all three autopsists (Humes, Boswell, and Finck) examined these materials at the National Archives. Their report authenticates the photos and x-rays as genuine. Randy Robertson MD, is a radiologist and conspiracy oriented researcher who recently got access to materials that have langished virtually unnoticed for decades: images on 120 film shot during the JFK autopsy. While the images don't allow any forensic conclusions, they do bear on the authenticity of the other autopsy photos which do allow such conclusions. This is his report . What Do the Experts Say About the Evidence? For several years, no independent experts had access to the photos and x-rays from Kennedy’s autopsy. In the late 60s, Attorney General Ramsey Clark appointed a panel of forensic pathologists to examine these materials. Here is their report . What Happened to Kennedy’s Brain? The most famous piece of missing evidence in the world is John Kennedy’s brain. What happened to it? Did The Conspiracy grab it because it contained incontrovertible evidence that Kennedy was shot from the front? The HSCA made a strong effort to find out what happened. Their report makes it pretty clear what did. Why Was Kennedy’s Coffin Disposed Of? Like the missing brain, it sounds outrageous. The casket that carried Kennedy’s body from Dallas to Washington was in fact disposed of by the federal government — dropped into the Atlantic Ocean. Was this part of some sinister coverup? Released documents tell the story. Here is a sample from The Smoking Gun website , and here is a larger collection . Another supposed piece of missing evidence is a bullet that Admiral Osborne said he saw fall out of the wrapping of Kennedy’s body when it arrived at Bethesda. OSBORNE.TXT is the HSCA’s investigation of this claim. "Military Control" of the Autopsy? Conspiracy books describe, based on a very selective use of Dr. Finck’s testimony in the Clay Shaw trial, an autopsy in which shadowy sinister military figures prevented a proper autopsy. The House Selected Committee did a thorough investigation of the conduct of the autopsy, based on interviews with virtually all the participants. See just why such a poor job was done. An added bonus: that receipt for a "missile" is explained. A full account of autopsist Pierre Fink’s experiences at the autopsy can be found in the "Blumberg Memo" written on 1 February 1965. Click here to see the memo . Key Concept: Probing a wound. Conspiracy books place great emphasis on the fact that the autopsists were unable to probe the wound in Kennedy’s back more than a inch or so into the body. They believe that this proves that the bullet didn’t penetrate more then an inch or so. Forensic pathologists don’t accept this idea. The following is a quote from the Forensic Pathology Panel of the House Select Committee on Assassinations: (430) The panel believes that the difficulty which Drs. Humes, Finck, and Boswell experienced in trying to place a soft probe through the bullet pathway in President Kennedy’s neck probably resulted from their failure or inability to manipulate this portion of the body into the same position it was in when the missile penetrated. Rigor mortis may have hindered this manipulation. Such placement would have enabled reconstruction of the relationships of the neck and shoulder when the missile struck. It is customary, however, to dissect missile tracks to determine damage and pathway. Probing a track blindly may produce false tracks and misinformation. Were the Body Snatchers at Work? David Lifton is far from the worst JFK assassination researcher. Indeed, he’s a pretty good JFK researcher. But he supports some very bad theories. For example, he believes that Kennedy’s body was taken and surgically altered between Parkland Hospital and the autopsy in Bethesda. Supposedly, this was done to conceal the fact that all the shots that hit Kennedy came from the front. Is this as crazy as it sounds? Yes, it is. Joel Grant has carefully examined the 14 minute period during which Lifton says Kennedy’s body must have been stolen from Air Force One. In fact, the coffin was never unattended long enough for body snatchers to do their work. Physician Bob Artwohl has carefully examined Lifton’s use of medical evidence and eyewitness testimony. Here is his critique of Lifton’s theories , originally messages on Compuserve addressed to Lifton. Uploaded here by permission of Artwohl. Long time University of Wisconsin professor and assassination researcher David Wrone looks at the evidence on Lifton’s theory, and finds that it simply wasn’t possible for conspirators to make off with the body . Dr. Wecht participated in a TV special where film was shown of a supposed "alien autopsy" (above). Was it really an alien? Click here for a web site where people expert in movie special effects critique the "autopsy." Really Pristine? Finally, it’s the "magic bullet" picture you never see in the conspiracy books: CE 399 viewed end-on. See for yourself whether this bullet is really "pristine." A Genuine Conspiracy "Expert?" The expert the conspiracy books are always quoting is Cyril Wecht, forensic pathologist and long-time advocate of a conspiracy. Wecht is a competent forensic pathologist where the Kennedy assassination is not involved. Unfortunately the part of his book Cause of Death dealing with the assassination is awash in mistakes and inaccuracies. When Wecht appeared online on the Prodigy service in 1994, Dr. Robert Artwohl challenged him on several errors and misrepresentations in the book . Wecht failed to respond to any of Artwohl’s messages. Wecht has claimed that Kennedy's "back and to the left" motion indicates a shot from the Grassy Knoll. But when called as a expert witness in the Menendez retrial, he insisted that simple Newtonian physics isn't much use in determining how people will react to a shot . When the Rockefeller Commission (The Commission on CIA Activities) examined the assassination, in the 1970s, Wecht was an important figure claiming that there was a conspiracy. Given his good medical credentials, the Commission made a point of talking with him, and indeed questioned him closely. When the Commission's report was released, Wecht fussed and fumed that he had been misrepresented, and that he had given the Commission much convincing evidence of a conspiracy, but was ignored. In this essay , Megan Knuth examines what Wecht said, based on the transcript of his interview with the Commission, and compares it with how his testimony is presented in the Commission's Report . Was he really misrepresented? Return to Kennedy Assassination Home Page

Lee Harvey Oswald -- Lone Assassin or Patsy? LEE HARVEY OSWALD . . . if you put the murdered President of the United States on one side of a scale and that wretched waif Oswald on the other side, it doesn't balance. You want to add something weightier to Oswald. It would invest the President's death with meaning, endowing him with martyrdom. He would have died for something. . . . A conspiracy would, of course, do the job nicely. — William Manchester. A n historical enigma, Lee Harvey Oswald is at the center of the assassination, regardless of whether you consider him the lone gunman, a coconspirator who was also a patsy, or totally innocent.

Lee Oswald: Troubled Youth The whole lone assassin case hangs on the notion that Lee Harvey Oswald was the sort of disturbed individual who might have shot the president. If he was, what were the roots of his psychological problems? Oswald's chronic truancy after he and his mother moved to New York in 1952 landed him in Youth House, a facility for troubled teenagers. There professionals on the staff conducted a thorough examination of him. "Lee Oswald: Troubled Youth" is the Warren Commission's summary of what they found. Oswald's Defection to the USSR The circumstances of Oswald's defection to the USSR, and his time in Moscow are covered in detail, and with interesting new sources, on the "Lee Harvey Oswald in Russia" web site run by Peter Wronski. How Did the Soviets View Oswald? If Oswald was sent to the USSR by U.S. intelligence, did authorities in the communist state find any evidence of that, or any reason to believe he was other than a mixed-up kid? In the early 1990s, many KGB files were released, and the Soviet paper Izvestia ran a story on what they revealed . Then, later in that decade, authorities turned a cache of documents over to President Clinton . Oswald in Holland On the way back to the U.S. from Russia, Lee and Marina passed through the Netherlands and boarded a ship in Rotterdam. Does some mystery surround this? Perry Vermeulen has a web site on the subject . He's not pushing any particular theory, but filling in holes in the historical record. "Suspicious" Happenings in Oswald's Life Conspiracy authors specialize in finding "spooky" or "suspicious" happenings in the life of Lee Oswald — happenings that supposedly reveal some sinister connection with a government agency or other group of possible assassination conspirators. Some of the employees at Oswald's place of work in New Orleans, the Reily Coffee Company, left to take jobs at a nearby NASA facility . Lee and Maria Oswald, when they returned from the USSR to the Dallas/Fort Worth area, supposedly lost some of their luggage . In the Marines, Lee Oswald got gonorrhea in a manner the Marines ruled "in the line of duty . . . not due to own misconduct." Does this imply that Oswald was, for example, sleeping with prostitutes on orders from some intelligence agency? Mark Zaid, a JFK assassination researcher and a lawyer, looked into this legal determination . Conspiracy authors have exploited the Warren Commission's inability to explain how Lee Oswald — during his defection to the USSR — got from London to Helsinki to suggest some sinister intelligence plot afoot. Author Chris Mills' research on the topic reveals a simple solution to the puzzle — one the Warren Commission should have produced. Conspiracy books often claim that Oswald had "Top Secret" or even "crypto" security clearance, which supposedly indicates some sinister connection to some intelligence agency. The House Select Committee on Assassinations got to the bottom of this issue. Here is their report On the streets of New Orleans, Oswald got into a violent confrontation with anti-Castro activists. Conspiracy books will tell you that a police officer said the confrontation was "staged," implying that Oswald was in league with the activists. Read the actual testimony and see what the officer (Francis Martello) actually said. Oswald supposedly tried, when in custody of the Dallas police, to make a call to a somewhat suspicious person in Raleigh, North Carolina. Is this actually a tip-off to some intelligence connection ? Why’d He Do It? There is no way an examination of Lee Oswald's character and personality can prove he was the lone assassin. Prove that he was a malcontent loner, and you've only proved that he was the perfect patsy for some conspiracy. Prove that he was enamoured of spy games and false identities, and you simply open the possibility that real intelligence operatives suckered him into a game that cost him his life. But people do have a right to demand that lone gunman theorists provide a plausible account of how malcontent Oswald might have chosen to kill Kennedy. Starting with the Warren Commission Report , and continuing with books like Jean Davison's Oswald's Game , they have indeed done so. Three essays on this site address these issues. Jerry Organ is a lone assassin theorist who believes that Oswald was indeed willing to kill for political reasons, as he argues in "The Oswald Agenda" . Mel Ayton, while giving due weight to Oswald's leftist politics, provides an especially incisive discussion of the personal motives that drove Oswald. Ayton analyzes the claimed assassin within the framework of a classic psychological study of pathological murderers -- one published before the Kennedy assassination (which is important, since it could not in any way have been slanted or biased to implicate Oswald). David Chirko provides a psychological analysis of Oswald , using standard categories of mental dysfunction. Influence of Communist Papers? Oswald subscribed to and read two Communist newspapers: The Worker and The Militant . Joseph Bukowski has examined the content of these journals in the months leading up to the assassination , showing that both portrayed the U.S. as a bitter enemy of the Castro regime. Thus pro-Castro Oswald may have seen himself as protecting Cuban communism by killing Kennedy. Are the Backyard Photos Genuine? The HSCA analysis of the famous Oswald backyard photos. If you're used to reading the likes of Jack White on this subject, you'll find this analysis a revelation. Conspiracists have long claimed that the photos are faked because they show Oswald leaning in a way he could not have been in real life. Modern computer modeling allows this theory to be tested, and it has been in "A 3-D Stability Analysis of Lee Oswald in the Backyard Photo." Oswald "Sightings" Conspiracy books list large numbers of witnesses who saw Lee Oswald in all sorts of places the Warren Commission said he wasn't: in the Carousel Club, on a shooting range, talking to "Maurice Bishop," visiting Sylvia Odio. Just how seriously should these witness accounts be taken? Are they the evidence that blows the lid off the coverup, or are they just like claims of people who saw Elvis at the Laundromat? In this section of the Warren Commission Report , the Commission investigates several of these claims. Of all the many Oswald sightings, one has loomed particularly large in conspiracy literature, and even been accepted by some sober lone assassin theorists: the case of Sylvia Odio. Odio, one night in late September 1963, was visited by three men, one Anglo and three Hispanics, and after the assassination she came to believe that the Anglo was Lee Harvey Oswald. Odio was apparently an honest witness, but most likely the fellow she saw was not Oswald . And here is a late 1950's picture of Ray Herbert of the Chicago White Sox . "What," you may be asking, "is the point?" Look at the photo and ask yourself: "How many guys who looked a lot like Oswald were running around in 1963, easily misidentified as our boy Lee?" Cecil Jones discovered this photo. The House Select Committee on Assassinations found Odio a "credible" witness — although they stopped short of flatly stating that Oswald had indeed visited Odio's apartment. Here is their report on this incident , authored by Gaeton Fonzi. Was Odio the sort of woman who might have offered a mistaken identification, and even been hysterical about it? Her psychiatrist, Burton C. Einspruch, testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978. Here is his assessment of his patient . One whole spate of sightings occurred in a place called Alice, Texas where seventeen separate witnesses thought they saw Lee Oswald — usually with Marina and a babe in arms. In an essay from his web site, Dave Reitzes reviews these sightings and explains why they are bogus . G-Man Assigned to the Case FBI agent James Hosty (pictured at left) was the man the bureau assigned to keep tabs on Lee Oswald after he returned from New Orleans to Dallas. Although he failed to contact Oswald until after the assassination, he twice visited Marina and Mrs. Paine. Intimately involved in the case, his views on a broad variety of issues are recorded in this interview by researcher Steve Bochan . Bochan's interview shows an interesting FBI "insiders" view. A Propensity for Violence? The Walker assassination attempt is an extremely important incident, judged by both the Warren Commission and by the House Select Committee to indicate Oswald's propensity for violence. How strong is the evidence against Oswald? This section of the Warren Commission Report deals with this incident. If Oswald shot at Walker, it is extremely easy to believe that he shot at Kennedy seven months later. Conspiracy books try to attack the Warren Commission version of the Walker shooting by citing a witness, Walter Coleman, who supposedly saw two men fleeing the scene. Read the FBI report of Coleman's testimony , and see whether it in any way challenges the Commission's version. Local Media Celebrity T he high point of Lee Oswald's campaign of pro-Castro activism occurred in New Orleans where Oswald appointed himself Secretary of a rump chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. As spokesman for the Committee, Oswald appeared on WDSU Radio twice. An initial taped interview with William Stuckey was edited down to less than five minutes and broadcast on "Latin Listening Post" on August 17, 1963. Here is the full, unedited, version of the Stuckey/Oswald interview . A debate between Oswald and anti-Castro activists Ed Butler and Carlos Bringuier was broadcast live on WDSU on August 21, 1963. This debate essentially ended Oswald's public activism on behalf of the Castro regime when his defection to the Soviet Union was revealed. Michael O'Dell kindly supplied these audio clips. More Than One "Oswald?" A recurring theory has been that there were "two Oswalds" — one the birth Lee Harvey Oswald, and another a look-alike substituted for the real Lee Oswald by some sinister people for some sinister reason. And authors pushing this theory can produce considerable "evidence" to support it. But just how well does this "evidence" fare under critical scrutiny? "Guiding Hands" Leading Lee to the Depository? If Lee Oswald was the designated patsy in the assassination, then the "guiding hands" of The Conspiracy had to be leading him to his job in the building overlooking the parade route. Just how did Lee get his job? This essay by Joel Grant explores the issue. Of course, yet another set of "guiding hands" had to be working to bring John Kennedy down Elm Street. Grant also explores this possibility in his essay "The Three Furies." Do we see the sinister workings of a conspiracy here, or merely the working out of a perverse fate? A Brother's Pain The "victims" in the assassination also included Oswald's family, who had to bear the pain of being associated with the killer. Here is the first-person account of Robert Oswald , Lee's brother. At Lee's funeral his family grieves. From left to right: Marina, June, Robert, Marguerite, Rachael, and the Reverend Louis Saunders . Playing the Victim Game If Oswald was in fact a Marxist, conspiracy theorists often ask, why did he not proclaim himself to be JFK's killer, and proudy declare his political beliefs? The answer lies in the value of the "Victim Game," something that since the late 60s we have heard from minorities wanting the benefit of affirmative action programs, from militia types claiming Federal persecution, and indeed from all sorts of groups. But the Old Left pioneered the Victim Game, and Oswald's mother headed Lee in that direction even before he became a leftist. Russ Burr explains this recurring factor in Lee's behavior in his brief essay " I'm Just a Patsy ." Did Oswald Have a Mistress in New Orleans in the Summer of 1963? Circa 2000, a woman named Judyth Vary Baker began contacting JFK researchers, claiming to have been in an adulterous affair with Lee Oswald in the summer before the assassination. Her story has many juicy details, including a CIA sponsored project to create a bioweapon to kill Castro. Evenually, she published two books based on her claims. Does her story have any credibility? This article dissects the arcane and labyrinthine twists and turns of her account . Was the Evidence Against Oswald "Inadmissible" Conspiracy books attack the evidence against Oswald by claiming that the "chain of custody" was broken for most of it, and that only marking evidence is sufficient to establish a "chain of custody" for legal purposes. This legal brief submitted by the plaintiffs in the O. J. Simpson civil trial shows this claim to be untrue. All the key pieces of evidence (the rifle, the hulls in the Depository, the hulls at 10th and Patton, materials from Oswald's rooming house and from the Paines' house in Irving) would have been legally admissible. Oswald Writes to Commend Communist Newspaper Lee Oswald not only subscribed to the Trotskyist newspaper The Militant , he wrote a letter to the editor commending the paper for "analysis and coverage of the labor movement" that was "unsurpassed." Paul Hoch kindly supplied this image. Was Oswald "Denied Counsel?" A common theme in conspiracy books is that Oswald was "denied counsel" when in the custody of the Dallas Police. The real story is more complex, and tells us a lot about just how Lee Oswald thought. Oswald, in His Own Defense , an essay by Joel Grant and John Locke, explores this issue. Should Oswald’s Interrogation Have Been Recorded? To anybody who watches TV crime dramas, it might seem obvious that Lee Harvey Oswald's interrogation should have been taped. Isn't that what the cops always do? Given the massive stakes in this case, isn't it suspicious that no audio recording was made? Unfortunately, what seems "obvious" today doesn't necessarily apply in 1963. As late as 2004, the Northwestern University School of Law Center on Wrongful Convictions was urging police departments to record interrogations . Indeed, their survey of police practices in that year showed that virtually no departments recorded suspect interrrogations as far back as 1963. As researcher Sandy McCroskey (who discovered this report) pointed out: All departments in Alaska record [interrogations] and had been doing so for nineteen years in 2004. That means they weren't in 1963, as they started only in 1985. Los Angeles had been recording for 23 years in 2004. That means they started only in 1981. What about New York City? Well, all we have for that state is Broome County, and it didn't start until 2002! Chicago? No department in Illinois started before 1994. Washington, DC started in 2003. No police department in Texas was recording interrogations until 1992. And of course, in 2004 a large number of departments still didn't record interrogations, a reality the Center on Wrongful Convictions was trying to reform. Lee Oswald: In His Own Words To understand the assassination a necessary — but alas, not sufficient — requirement is that you understand Lee Oswald. To believe the lone assassin theory you have to conclude that here was a man who in fact could have shot John Kennedy in cold blood. Of course, concluding that Oswald was this sort of man doesn't rule out a conspiracy. Intelligent conspirators would certainly frame a man who looked capable of being the lone gunman. But even if Oswald did it by himself, were his motives mainly personal, or political? We can start to examine the theory of Oswald the political assassin by looking at his own writings . Was this man capable of killing to achieve a political objective? Sinister Meeting with "Maurice Bishop?" The story is a favorite of Gaeton Fonzi, and of Tony Summers. Lee Oswald supposedly met with the very sinister "Maurice Bishop" (believed by many buffs to be the CIA's David Atlee Phillips ) in Dallas in late August or early September 1963. Never mind that he was in New Orleans all this time, the story has other massive credibility problems , as the HSCA investigation made clear. The witness who claimed to place Oswald with Phillips is one Antonio Veciana, who after years of evasion and failing to identify "Bishop" finally did so shortly before his death. But as researcher Tracy Parnell shows, Veciana could hardly be less reliable . In addition to the twists and turns in his story (and a questionable behavior of Gaeton Fonzi), the fact that he was convicted of drug dealing in the 70s doesn't help his credibility. Lee's Political Views O n July 27, 1963, Lee was accompanied by Dutz and Lillian Murret (his aunt and uncle) and Marina to speak at the House of Studies at Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama. There he discussed his experiences in the Soviet Union before an audience of Jesuit seminarians. Among a variety of views he expressed was the following: Question: Why don't the Russians see they are being indoctrinated and they are being denied the truth by these jamming stations? Answer: They are convinced that such contact would harm them and would be dangerous. They are convinced that the state is doing them a favor by denying them access to Western radio broadcasts. Source: Commission Exhibit 2649, 25H727-728. Was it Really Curtain Rods? The paper bag at right, photographed in the National Archives, was claimed by the Warren Commission to be the one that Lee Oswald used to bring his Mannlicher-Carcano rifle to the Texas School Book Depository on the morning of the assassination. Conspiracists, of course, disagree. Just what does the evidence show ? Is there a viable alternative to the Warren Commission conclusion? Oswald a Homosexual? That's what Jim Garrison thought, and conspiracy writers have even uncovered a CIA document that says he was . But Lee's wife Marina told the intimate details of their sex life to Priscilla McMillan, and the KGB spied on Lee and Marina's Minsk apartment round-the-clock. It's clear that Lee was heterosexual, and the CIA document and the way conspiracy authors have interpreted it tell us more about them than about Lee's sex life. Ruth Paine's Kindness: No Good Deed Goes Unpunished The woman at right is Ruth Paine, who took Marina Oswald and June Oswald into her home at a time when the Oswald family was in need of support. This act of kindness enmeshed her in the horror of November 22, 1963, and the turmoil over the assassination that continues to this day. Writer Thomas Mallon offers a perceptive study of the character of Mrs. Paine and the dynamics of the Paine household in "Marina and Ruth: The Assassin's Wife and the Quaker Woman Who Took Her In." Lying About Ruth Paine's Daughter Conspiracists typically believe that Ruth Paine was some sort of spook or intelligence operative, assigned to help set up Oswald as the patsy in an assassination plot. One particularly noxious piece of "evidence" they provide is the idea that Mrs. Paine's daughter knows her mother was an assassination conspirator, and is estranged from her mother for that reason. Author Thomas Mallon actually interviewed Paine's daughter to determine what the truth is . Lee's Lies Regardless of whether Lee Oswald was a lone-nut assassin, he was clearly not the All-American Boy. He schemed, deceived, manipulated, and hoodwinked through all of his short adult life. In the essay "Lee's Lies" Brian Dautch outlines some of his many untruths. The Straight Scoop on Lee / Some of the most damning testimony about Lee Oswald came from his wife Marina. Conspiracy authors have attacked this testimony, pointing out that Marina was a recent immigrant to the United States, was fearful of the authorities, and spoke English very poorly. These criticisms are well taken, but they don't apply to her testimony before the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The following is from Volume II of the Hearings of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, pp. 301-302. Due to remarriage, Marina is "Mrs. Porter" here. The testimony was given on September 14, 1978. Note her endorsement of Priscilla Johnson McMillan's Marina and Lee as an accurate account. Chairman STOKES. Now again you know Priscilla Johnson McMillan, don't you? Mrs. PORTER. Yes, sir. Chairman STOKES. That is the lady who wrote the book "Marina and Lee." Mrs. PORTER. Yes. Chairman STOKES. And you talked with her with reference to what she was writing about the book, didn't you? Mrs. PORTER. Sure. Chairman STOKES. You have read that book? Mrs. PORTER. Yes; not recently but a year ago. Chairman STOKES. I beg your pardon? Mrs. PORTER. A year ago, yes. Chairman STOKES. A year ago, right. Let me read this passage to you from the book. I am reading at page 436. "Marina was now certain that Lee was guilty. She saw his guilt in his eyes. Moreover, she knew that had he been innocent, he would have been screaming to high heaven for his rights, claiming he had been mistreated, and demanding to see officials at the very highest levels, just as he had always done before. For her, the fact that he was so compliant, that he told her he was being treated all right, was a sign that he was guilty." Did you tell Miss Johnson that? Mrs. PORTER. Yes. Chairman STOKES. Now in addition to it, you told Miss Johnson, did you not, about the police coming and taking away many possessions, and one of the possessions that they left was a small demitasse cup, and when you looked and discovered the fact that they had not taken the cup, you also found in there Lee's wedding ring. Did you tell her about that? Mrs. PORTER. Well, I do not — I remember the demitasse, but it is missed. I don't know where it is. Are you asking me did I find Lee's ring? Chairman STOKES. Did you find his ring? Mrs. PORTER. Yes, sir. Chairman STOKES. And then did you tell Miss Johnson this: "'Oh, no,' she thought, and her heart sank again, 'Lee never took his ring off, not even on his grimiest manual jobs.' She had seen him wearing it the night before. Marina suddenly realized what it meant. Lee had not just gone out and shot the President spontaneously. He had intended to do it when he left for work that day. Again things were falling into place. Marina told no one about Lee's ring." Did you tell Miss Johnson that? Mrs. PORTER. Yes. Chairman STOKES. As my time has expired, the Chair would request unanimous consent to proceed for 3 additional minutes. Without objection. Now did you tell — Mr. FAUNTROY. Overruled, Mr. Chairman. Chairman STOKES. That is democracy. Mrs. Porter, it has always been important for the American people to ascribe some motive to this killing. And I notice further that, in the same book, Miss Johnson writes this, and I am reading at page 434 of the book: "In his eyes, his political ideas stood higher even than himself. He would talk about Marxism, Communism, and injustice all over the world." Did you tell Miss Johnson that? Mrs. PORTER. That was Miss Johnson's conclusion about studying Lee as a person. Her findings weren't based only on what I told her. She did great research and met with lots of people who knew Lee. That was her conclusion, and I agree with her.

Judyth Vary Baker -- Claims to Have Been Oswald's Girlfriend in New Orleans in 1963 Lee Oswald’s Girlfriend in New Orleans? Secret CIA Bioweapons Researcher? Should We Believe Judyth Baker? If Judyth Vary Baker is telling the truth, it will change the way we think about the Kennedy assassination. Judyth offers an account that integrates much that has been written about the assassination into a more or less coherent whole, and puts myriad facts about the assassination in an entirely new light. She has recently been in the Netherlands, getting some attention in the Dutch media, and has opened a museum dedicated to telling her story. She was the subject of “The Men Who Killed Kennedy” which aired in November, 2003 on the History Channel. Her supporters have promised a book. She may turn into someone important on the JFK assassination scene. But is she to be believed? Primary Sources on Judyth Key sources on the “Judyth” story include: – an essay sarcastically titled “My Boring Life,” a response to David Lifton’s claim that Judyth has fabricated her story to add some interest to a her boring life. – a biographical blurb written to her high school classmates and posted on the web page of Manatee High School. There were two versions of the blurb posted, one a bit “sanitized” after it apparently occurred to Judyth that her original version contained some things that are hard to swallow. Space constraints have forced her blurb off the current version of the high school alumni page. – an outline, titled “Deadly Alliance,” sent to publishers and researchers. Carefully formatted and polished, this is the “official” version of her story – at least it was when it was written. In this essay, “the Judyth account” or “Judyth’s account” refers to “Deadly Alliance.” – a draft of the final chapter of her book, titled “Before the Silence Came: Lee’s Last Telephone Calls.” – a rambling version of her story and a response to critics written in November 2003. – Yet another web page from Judyth, including several photos, and samples of Judyth’s artwork. – An interview she did with Dutch radio. The narration is in Dutch, but Judyth speaks in English. – A current (as of July, 2012) web page on Judyth. It contains links to several video clips, including Judyth’s segment in the 2003 documentary, The Men Who Killed Kennedy Star Science Student Recruited into Deadly Conspiracy Judyth’s saga begins when she was a student at Manatee High School in Bradenton, Florida. Among fellow students who remember her, opinion is about evenly split between remembering her as “intelligent” and remembering her as “weird,” but she appears to have been an excellent science student who conducted “cancer research” with mice. She received a fair amount of recognition for her academic prowess, attending national workshops for science students. But her life took an important turn when she came to the attention of Dr. Canute Michaelson in 1958. Michaelson (supposedly a “CIA asset” engaged in bioweapons research) somehow targeted her for future intelligence use. She was thus drawn into the orbit of very sinister people and eventually into a plot that had the intention of killing Castro, but ended up killing JFK instead. The “interesting” time in her life was the summer of 1963, when she was in New Orleans. It was there that she began, she claims, a torrid sexual affair with Lee Harvey Oswald, in spite of having been recently married to Robert Baker, a student and future petroleum geologist who was working for an oil company. What brought Judyth and Lee together was a plot, centered in New Orleans, to produce a bioweapon for the purpose of killing Fidel Castro. The plotters got them both “cover” jobs at the Reily Coffee Company while they were carrying on an affair and trying to produce a “cocktail” to administer to Castro. The “cocktail” would include both a virus designed to knock out Castro’s immune system, and cancer cells that would infect him and cause his death. Other participants in the plot included David Ferrie – every conspiracy author’s favorite suspect – and Dr. Mary Sherman, a physician at the Ochsner Clinic. The research was done in the apartments of Ferrie and Sherman. Oswald’s famous trip to Mexico City was, according to Baker, for the purpose of delivering the poison “cocktail” to an agent who would see to it that it got into Cuba and was administered to Castro. Oswald made it to Mexico City, but unfortunately the agent never arrived to claim the materials, and the plotters decided to kill John Kennedy instead. However, instead of using their sophisticated bioweapon concoction on him, they decided to simply shoot him. Oswald, who liked Kennedy, was an unwilling participant in the plot, but never defected nor told the authorities about the plan. He was in Dealey Plaza as a shooter, but intentionally missed Kennedy, although other shooters, of course, killed the President. Evaluation Some readers may be tempted to stop reading right now, given the sheer implausibility of the tale. That the CIA would need to develop a bioweapon to kill Castro is farfetched, since they had a variety of poisons that would have killed him – including some that would do so without it being obvious he was in fact murdered. Further, when the CIA wanted scientific research done, they were able to recruit top-notch Ph.D.-level university talent. Their research on toxins was headed by a renowned biologist. For the MK/ULTRA project (dealing with “mind control”) they recruited top university scientists. Yet we are supposed to believe that this particular project was carried out by a high-school dropout (Oswald), a college student with no advanced science classes (Baker), a fellow who had a mail order doctor’s degree from an institution in Italy (Ferrie) and a reputable doctor (Sherman) who was in fact an orthopedic surgeon. Ferrie, at one point, did own some mice, and told his friends he was engaged in “cancer research.” But then he also, at one point, had a large tank in his back yard which he claimed he was going to convert into a submarine to attack Castro’s Cuba. Judyth as a high school science student. She and her supporters have produced hard evidence of only two elements of her story: (1) she was a good science student in high school and (2) she worked at the Reily Coffee Company at the same time as Lee Oswald. The mice, by the way, were long gone from his apartment by the summer of 1963. And somehow the plotters couldn’t supply a proper facility, so the research was done in the apartments of two members of the team. Real CIA research was done in university labs, or at secure military installations. Judyth’s supposed encounter with Michaelson would have taken place when she was a first semester sophomore in high school. Given the CIA’s ability to recruit top-notch Ph.D. talent, it’s a bit odd to be told that they were scouting high school students. The notion of injecting Castro with cancer cells is pretty far-fetched. Knocking out his immune system would have resulted in his death without any additional ingredient in the “cocktail.” Judyth’s treatment of scientific issues is pretty slipshod. For example, in one e-mail she asked rhetorically “I would like to see a list of people involved in this case who died of lung cancer, especially if they did not smoke, such as Jack Ruby. And how many heart attacks (sodium morphate).” She further explained to researcher Gary Buell that: Gary, David Ferrie told me about it. I actually believed at that time that there was nothing Dave did not know. In medical matters like this he described this as a method he could use to commit suicide and people would think it was a heart attack. There would be no way to discern it wasn’t a natural death. Buell investigated this, and found that there is no such thing as “sodium morphate.” But if there is no such poison that can induce a heart attack, where did Judyth get this? Her apparent source is a crackpot conspiracy essay that appeared in 1975 titled “The Skeleton Key to the Gemstone File.” That document states that sodium morphate is “a favorite Mafia poison for centuries. Smells like apple pie, and is sometimes served up in one, as to J. Edgar Hoover. Sometimes in a pill or capsule. Symptoms: Lethargy, sleep, sometimes vomiting. Once ingested, there is a heart attack – and no trace is left in the body.” Thus a poison Ferrie supposedly told Judyth about in 1963 is nowhere in the medical literature, not part of crackpot conspiracy literature until 1975, but all over the internet by the time Judyth was sending out her e-mails circa 2000. “Deadly Alliance” says that the virus in the “cocktail” on which the little band of researchers was working was the AIDS virus, but she told various Dutch media outlets that she was working with SV-40 (Simian Virus 40). This latter virus, which contaminated early batches of Polio Vaccine, does not cause cancer in humans and isn’t the AIDS virus nor a related one. Thus it wouldn’t in fact be of much use in a bioweapons program. When she was interviewed for “The Men Who Killed Kennedy” in 2003, the virus to knock out Castro’s immune system had been replaced by a plan to expose Castro to repeated doses of radiation to help the cancer along. How the CIA – which failed to even once expose Castro to any of the toxins it had – was going to arrange for the repeated doses of radiation is something Judyth didn’t explain. Does She Have Evidence? Even if Baker’s account sounds implausible, one might take it seriously if she has actual evidence to support her story. Indeed, she does have “evidence.” For example, she has employment records showing that she did work at the Reily Coffee Company at the same time Lee did. She has a green glass, of the sort that Reily gave to customers as a premium, that she says that Lee stole and gave to her, and which she treasures. How do we know that Lee gave it to her? She says he did. Does the Book Clear Things Up? The release of her book (which was quickly withdrawn) might seem to have been an opportunity for Judyth to bring coherence and plausibility to her story – although nothing could wipe out the extensive paper trail showing its previous twists and turns. Unfortunately for Judyth, the book merely added more baroque complexity to her account, and more complexity meant more contradictions and more incredible elements. Several of these surround a science fair that she attended in 1960. Barb Junkkarinen dissects Judyth’s claims in her essay Judyth vs. History . She has a letter from Senator George Smathers commending her for her prowess in the sciences. She says this shows that people in high places had noticed her and were slating her for a covert mission. But it is, in reality, evidence that senators have staffs who comb newspapers for names to which letters can be sent to ingratiate the senator with constituents. There is at least one witness who confirms part of Judyth’s account. Anna Lewis, the former wife of one David Lewis, confirms Judyth’s claim that she and Lee went on several dates with Anna and David. This might seem like solid corroboration, but David Lewis was in New Orleans during the Garrison investigation, and was telling all kinds of stories – stories which even the Garrison people came to reject. But he said nothing at all about any “double dates” with Lee and someone who could have been Judyth. So to believe Anna Lewis, we have to believe that her husband told the District Attorney’s office a bunch of implausible tales, but concealed one genuinely explosive thing that he knew. Interestingly, Anna Lewis, with her important “corroboration” of Judyth’s story, doesn’t appear in “The Men Who Killed Kennedy.” The dates with David and Anna Lewis don’t appear in the earlier versions of her story. For example, she told researcher Robert Harris that she and Lee double-dated with an old girlfriend of hers from high school and the girlfriend’s fiancé. The two got married in September of 1963. Harris grew suspicious of the story when Judyth could not recall the name of the woman, in spite of their supposedly having been best friends in high school. Judyth told Harris that Marina was constantly alone at night, due to the attention Lee was paying to her. But Marina told Ray and Mary La Fontaine that Lee never failed to come home after work and was almost never late. Marina said the same thing in her testimony at the Clay Shaw trial. It in fact is unlikely that Judyth or anybody else spent evenings out with Lee Oswald in the summer of 1963. She also claims to have at least one handwriting sample from Lee, in the form of inscriptions written in the margins of a book. The inscriptions are, conveniently, written in pencil, which means they cannot be dated as ink inscriptions could be. Are they in Lee’s handwriting? Judyth says they are, but when Judyth’s supporters, known to critics as “Team Judyth,” are asked about the verdict of questioned documents experts, they simply claim that “preliminary reports” are favorable. Since it has been several years, one has to wonder why there isn’t a definitive assessment. Interestingly, early on she wasn’t mentioning any handwriting samples from Lee. For example, in an e-mail she wrote in late July 2001 she claims: 1. Two sheets of stationery from the Reily coffee company. 2. Dated streetcar transfers 3. An ink bottle Lee supposedly used to fill his fountain pen 4. A W-2 form from Reily Coffee Company She then claims to have “hundreds of documents and other items.” In another e-mail she claimed to have Lee’s “shower shoes.” But in spite of mentioning such inconclusive pieces of evidence, she failed to say anything about the writing samples. The “shower shoes” are interesting. In fact, the Warren Commission did indeed enter a pair of Lee Oswald’s flip-flops into evidence as Warren Commission Exhibit 148. But these flip-flops remain in the National Archives in College Park, Maryland. Perhaps Lee had another pair of flip-flops. But why would a wife trying to conceal an adulterous affair keep a pair of her lover’s shoes? The “shower shoes” appear to be yet another example of Judyth latching onto some piece of assassination trivia and weaving it into her narrative. Judyth does have several love letters that she says she wrote to Lee. Unfortunately, the name of the addressee has been torn off each of the letters, and Judyth’s word is the only evidence they were actually written to Lee. Robert Baker’s second wife, Rose Boory-Baker, provides a suggestion as to the real nature of the letters. I have seen those letters. Judy wouldn’t even have them if I had not sent them to her daughter years ago. She left those personal letters in Norway when she flew the coop. There is nothing in the letters between her and Bob that would give any type of evidence of which you are implying. Quite frankly, how in the heck are you going to present a love letter from Judy to “Lee” when she tore off the name. She wrote many love letters to Bob. Gosh, if I knew now what I knew then [sic], the box would have never been sent . . . . If Judyth’s pieces of “evidence” point to a pretty prosaic life, independent sources show her life to have been much more mundane than she portrays it. For example, her former husband remembers that, rather than being mysteriously “set up” with the job at Reily Coffee Company, she got it when she got tired of flipping hamburgers at a local burger joint . After the summer in New Orleans, she and her husband were at the University of Florida in Gainesville. According to Robert Baker: Back in Gainesville, we heard about the assassination during the school term – like everyone else I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing. Later in the day or the next day, she brought home a newspaper and was studying it closely and said, “I think I may have seen this guy. He was a stocker or something. I think I saw him in the back room.” [capitalization corrected] Her classmates at Manatee High School do indeed remember her doing cancer research, but it was a rather amateurish sort. One day, all her mice escaped, and the “experimental” and “control” groups got mixed up. To prevent this happening again, she started color coding the mice – something no serious researcher would do since it violates the notion of a “double blind” research design. How Judyth Met Lee Judyth can’t resist adding implausible scenes to her account. Consider, for example, how she supposedly met Lee Oswald. It was through this amazing coincidence that Lee thought I knew so much. He was standing behind me [at the post office] for general delivery, April 26, when I went to get a letter from the general delivery. . . . As I got the letter, I reached for it, and dropped the newspaper, and when Lee picked it up, without realizing it, I thanked him in Russian. I was always practicing Russian (which I’d been required to learn to level of conversational by my doctors, etc – and which is on record at Manatee (then Jr.) Community College–) – so now Lee heard me saying, “Karashaw, tavarish!” in Russian, and he answered me quickly, “That’s not a very wise thing to do, to be speaking Russian in a place like this.” That did it, we began talking together. Judyth supposedly learned Russian because the conspirators who were controlling her demanded that she do so, but she could never give a coherent account of why they would do that. But a worse problem stems from the fact that Judyth maintains that both she and Lee were being controlled, at the time they met, by the plotters. The mystery is why the plotters would not simply invite both to (say) the Café du Monde , sit them down and say “Judyth, this is Lee. Lee, meet Judyth.” Why did they meet in a vastly improbable chance encounter? Or if the encounter was “set up” (as Judyth claims to suspect), why such an elaborate plot to have them meet? And why would Judyth speak Russian to a random stranger at the post office? By 2003, when Judyth was interviewed for “The Men Who Killed Kennedy” , the business about speaking Russian to Lee was missing, and instead Judyth explained that Lee was so “clean cut” that when he offered to walk her home she agreed. Judyth’s Cast of Shady Characters Judyth’s story implicates quite a lot of people in the plot to kill Castro – and then Kennedy – and virtually all of the people she implicates have had a more-or-less prominent place in JFK assassination conspiracy books. Dr. Alton Ochsner Ochsner was an important physician in New Orleans who founded the Ochsner Clinic, one of the nation’s top treatment centers. Ochsner was part of the New Orleans civic elite, and therefore knew Clay Shaw and served on some of the same civic projects as Shaw. Further, Ochsner was anti-Communist (as was, of course, virtually all the New Orleans civic elite), and was a key supporter of the Information Council of the Americas (an anti-Communist propaganda organization), so in the reverse McCarthyism that is typical of left-leaning conspiracists, he is suspect. According to Judyth’s account: Her appearance [as a teenager] at an international science fair brought her to the attention of other medical figures with military or intelligence backgrounds, as well as top officials of the American Cancer Society: Dr. Harold Diehl and Dr. Alton Ochsner (of the famed Ochsner Cancer Clinic in New Orleans). Ochsner was Judyth’s principal behind-the-scenes mentor through her late teen years. Interestingly, there was no “Ochsner Cancer Clinic,” but rather only an Ochsner Clinic – although of course the latter could treat cancer as it could treat most diseases. Judyth’s account finds Ochsner sinister because: Author Thomas Karnes ( Tropical Enterprise ) describes Ochsner as a consultant to the US Air Force “on the medical side of subversive matters.” It then goes on to claim . . . In early May, Judyth was told Ochsner had set up both Ferrie’s home-based cancer lab, as well as a smaller lab in the apartment of Dr. Mary Sherman, a luminary at Ochsner’s Clinic. The labs were devoted to “the medical side of subversive matters,” i.e., a form of biological warfare. In the first place, the Air Force isn’t the same thing as the CIA, and it’s the latter, not the former, that Judyth has as a key mover in the plot. But worse, Judyth (and her coauthor Platzman) fail to mention the source of the “medical side of subversive matters” quote. In fact, it first appeared in the conservative tabloid Human Events , which identified Ochsner in a 1967 article as “a world-traveled consultant to the surgeon general of the U.S. Air Force on the medical side of subversive matters . . . .” Thus Ochsner’s connection to the Air Force wasn’t something revealed by declassified top secret documents, but rather something he seems to have bragged about to Human Events . Whatever that phrase meant, it didn’t mean a secret bioweapons program. Further, Ochsner had an outstanding reputation as a humanitarian – a fact that left-leaning conspiracists, obsessed with his anti-Communism – never bother to discuss. Guy Banister A favorite villain of conspiracy writers, Banister could hardly be left out of Judyth’s story: Often Lee would go through The Crescent City Garage, next door to Reily’s, to get to the offices of ex-FBI man, now-CIA operative, Guy Banister, who was deeply involved in anti-Castro causes. This necessitated his befriending garage owner Adrian Alba. Why Oswald would have to go through the garage to get to Banister’s office is hard to fathom, since it would be much easier to just walk out on Magazine Street and then up Lafayette. A further mystery is why he would have to befriend Alba to do so. Judyth here seems to be taking a piece of assassination lore (Oswald really did befriend Alba, and the two discussed firearms), and weaving it into her story. Judyth claims that “Banister used Lee to collect the names of Communist sympathizers at area colleges” and that “Lee sometimes used a work area on the second floor of the 544 Camp building that housed Banister’s offices.” Further, “Judyth saw Lee sign out guns from Banister’s weapons storeroom on the third floor of 544 Camp Street in New Orleans. Lee also kept his own guns there.” In fact, Banister’s office was at 531 Lafayette Street, in the same Newman Building as 544 Camp, but with no connection with the offices at 544 Camp. To get from Banister’s office to 544 Camp, one had to leave the building and walk around the corner. In spite of extensive investigation by the Secret Service, the FBI, the Garrison office, the House Select Committee, and private researchers, no one has ever placed an Oswald “work area” on the second floor of the Newman Building, nor a “weapons storeroom” on the third floor. No one has placed Oswald at 544 Camp offices, with only one exception. Banister’s secretary Delphine Roberts did indeed claim that Oswald had an office there, but Roberts suffers from an extreme lack of credibility . She failed to come forward with her story until the late 70s, in spite of having been interviewed numerous times prior to that. Further, the building’s landlord, Sam Newman, the janitor and all the other tenants denied ever seeing Oswald there . Secret internal CIA documents , now released, show Banister not to have been any sort of CIA operative. He was, at the time Kennedy was shot, a washed-up former FBI agent who dabbled in anti-Castro and racist politics and had a drinking problem. Jack Ruby According to Judyth’s account : While Judyth was in Lee’s company, she met Jack Ruby twice, in May and June of 1963, once at Ferrie’s apartment and once at The 500 Club, a Marcello hang-out. Ruby worked with Banister and Marcello in running guns to Cuban exiles. Judyth knew Ruby as “Sparky” Rubenstein. When Lee was killed, she did not know that Jack Ruby and Sparky Rubenstein were the same man! The shock of seeing Lee killed on TV caused her to avoid all further coverage of the assassination. . . . In the first place, it’s extraordinarily implausible that Judyth could have been introduced to Jack Ruby as “Sparky Rubenstein” in the summer of 1963. Ruby had had the nickname since early childhood, and he became incensed at the mention of it. His sister told the Warren Commission that Ruby would fight when called by it. Reporter Hugh Aynesworth, who worked for the Dallas Morning News in 1963, says that “Never did I ever hear anybody in Dallas call Jack Ruby ‘Sparky.’ I knew him reasonably well, [and] was acquainted with scores of others who interacted [with] him in various ways.” The notion that Ruby was involved in “gun running” is an old one in conspiracy literature, and has been based on extremely flimsy evidence . There is only one documented instance when Ruby was in New Orleans in 1963: in June he traveled to the city to hire stripper Janet Conforto (stage name “Jada”) to work in his club. Neither Ferrie nor any of his roommates and friends have ever mentioned Ruby and Ferrie being together in New Orleans. When first introduced to Judyth, Ruby already knew Oswald. He told Judyth “I’ve known him ever since he was a little boy, when he was at parties and things like that.” According to Judyth, Ruby was the “bag man” who brought money from Texas to finance the New Orleans plot. Judyth portrays Ruby as having a compassionate side, in spite of the nefarious activities in which he was involved. Sparky was a very circular thinker, and had never had much education, but he wasn’t stupid. He understood that the means existed to mentally and physically torture somebody so that nothing would show. This knowledge terrified him: he could imagine it happening to each of us for getting involved as we were. I’ll never forget that he said he’d rather shoot any of us than see us go into a situation that might mean this kind of unseen and unknown torture. Certainly, he was ordered to kill Lee in the end. But if he had to convince himself that it was for the best, this is how he would have been able to do it: saving Lee from a fate worse than death by a mercy killing. Carlos Marcello, Dutz Murret New Orleans mob boss Marcello has been a hardy perennial among assassination suspects, and we could hardly expect Judyth to overlook him. Oswald’s uncle Dutz Murret had an apparent peripheral connection to the Marcello organization, which has provided conspiracy writers with a means of connecting Oswald with Marcello. Quoting the Judyth account: Judyth personally met other plotters, including Banister, Shaw, and Marcello, though, as a girl of 19 or 20, she was often treated as if she were wallpaper. Wallpaper with ears, a 160 IQ, and the ability to do cutting edge cancer research. Lee told Judyth that he first met Sparky when he was just 15, and that he spurned Ruby’s attempts to recruit him into Mob business. Even so, he ran errands for his uncle, Dutz Murrett [sic], who ran a bookmaking operation for Marcello. Judyth accompanied Lee on one such errand. Lee told Judyth that he was trusted by Mob figures, up to and including Marcello, for his ability to keep his mouth shut. Marcello told Ruby to look after the boy when the family moved to Texas. Needless to say, the established historical record, and even the “historical record” as recounted in conspiracy books, provides no corroboration for this. It’s exceedingly unlikely that Lee, living in New Orleans at age 15, would have met Ruby, who lived in Dallas. And Lee’s Uncle Dutz took a decidedly negative view of his nephew in New Orleans in 1963, being put off by Oswald pro-Castro sympathies and his failure to get a job and support his family. In a draft chapter of Judyth’s manuscript titled “Before the Silence Came: Lee’s Last Telephone Calls” she explains a phone call from Lee to her shortly before the assassination. Of particular note was Lee’s remarks that Carlos Marcello wanted to make sure his deportation trial (fueled by a personal vendetta run by Bobby Kennedy to kick Marcello out of the country for good) was going to end in New Orleans in his favor – the very day Kennedy visited Dallas. “Just to show how much power he really has,” Lee told me, “he is going to time it to coincide with –” Lee broke off, but of course I understood. “He has that much power,” I said, almost whispering into the phone. “He wants to rub Bobby’s nose in it.” Meaning, Marcello would deal a double dose of venom: if he could manage it, Marcello would time the very hour of his victory over Bobby Kennedy with Jack Kennedy’s assassination. That Marcello could control the exact time of his legal vindication is, or course, absurd. He was doubtless elated merely to be vindicated. Working for Marcello did, according to Judyth, have its perquisites. I ate with Lee downtown, we had free access to The Five Hundred Club, a free tab, had to pay nothing, same for Court of Two Sisters and a couple of other places run by Marcello’s people, where we could come in as long as it wasn’t night-time and order anything we wanted, tab on Marcello. David Ferrie Like Banister, Ferrie is an absolutely essential figure to include in any New Orleans-based plot. According to Judyth, soon after she arrived in New Orleans: Lee arranged for Judyth to meet David Ferrie, who she would soon learn was an associate of New Orleans Mafia boss Carlos Marcello, a CIA-operative who flew missions into Castro’s Cuba, and an “amateur cancer researcher.” In “The Men Who Killed Kennedy” , Judyth vividly describes Ferrie wearing an airline pilot’s uniform and cap. In reality, Ferrie had been fired by Eastern Airlines in September, 1961, and never flew for them or for any airline again. Ferrie did indeed do detective work for Marcello, but Ferrie was not a “CIA-operative” nor did he ever “fly missions into Castro’s Cuba.” Both are common conspiracy book factoids. Ferrie did apparently fancy himself a “cancer researcher” at one point, but lacked the knowledge and training to do any serious research. Even worse, his amateur “cancer experiments” ceased long before the summer of 1963, and Judyth’s claim of lab mice in Ferrie’s apartment at that time is flatly contradicted by several witnesses who knew Ferrie. Judyth’s account continues: Ferrie had lost his job as an Eastern Airlines pilot because of his homosexuality. The 15-year-old Lee had spurned Ferrie’s homosexual advances when Ferrie captained Lee’s Civil Air Patrol Unit (CAP). Lee and Ferrie taught combat techniques to Cuban exiles at the CIA-established training camp at Lake Pontchartrain (other camps were in Florida), and portions of these training sessions were filmed. Judyth saw this film in Ferrie’s apartment. This “training camp” account apparently stems from Robert Tanenbaum, who was for a short time Deputy Counsel of the House Select Committee on Assassinations and who claims to have seen such a film. Not surprisingly, no such film exists, and there is no evidence it ever existed beyond Tanenbaum’s assertion . Judyth appears to have gotten wind of the Tanenbaum claim and written it into her story. Shaw and Ferrie knew each other well. Judyth accompanied Lee to an airfield where Ferrie took the other two men on a flight to Canada. This appears to be taken from the testimony of a Garrison investigation witness named Jules Ricco Kimble , whose stories proved too wild for Garrison to use during the Clay Shaw trial, perhaps melded with elements drawn from a bogus Ferrie “flight plan” supplied to the Garrison investigation by a convict named Edward Girnus. The “flight plan” was discussed in William Davy’s book Let Justice Be Done which is critiqued on this web site . Ferrie is woven all through the Judyth story. Judyth claims, for example, to have traveled to Jackson, Louisiana (near Clinton) as part of a notorious expedition that included Shaw, Ferrie, and Oswald. The real purpose of that trip, according to Judyth, was to test the lethal “cocktail” intended for Castro on an unfortunate patient in the local mental hospital. The “Clinton trip” is, of course, another staple of the conspiracy literature that doesn’t hold up under historical scrutiny. Further, Judyth’s account of the mental patient got “enhanced” a bit when she talked to “The Men Who Killed Kennedy.” In that documentary, she claimed the experiments were carried out on a group of prisoners from Angola Prison, an entire “convoy.” A car containing David Ferrie, Lee Oswald, Clay Shaw, and an orderly entered the gates of the Jackson mental hospital immediately behind the prisoners. And just as the plot against Castro got “adjusted” to include multiple doses of radiation rather than a virus to destroy the immune system, the 2003 account has an experimental subject in the Jackson hospital exposed to a “high dosage x-ray.” Ferrie’s relationship with Judyth extended through the days following the assassination, which Judyth says Ferrie opposed. According to the outline “Deadly Alliance:” Lee and Judyth had made plans for an escape and rendezvous in Mexico. Judyth tells of Ferrie sobbing uncontrollably during phone calls with him because it had all gone so wrong. Earlier versions of Judyth’s account add other dimensions to Ferrie’s role. Judyth told researcher Louis Girdler that Ferrie showed her the “manual” for the CIA’s top secret MK/ULTRA program. Unfortunately, there was never any such thing as a “manual” for the highly sensitive program that researched “mind control.” Further, it’s absurd to think that the CIA would give such information to a New Orleans oddball. Even trusted agents would not have been shown any MK/ULTRA materials unless they had a clear “need to know.” Judyth backtracked a bit, and in a later version of her story said Ferrie had “MK/ULTRA materials” or “MK/ULTRA” documents. But this is equally implausible. Clay Shaw While many conspiracists have rejected Jim Garrison’s “case” against Clay Shaw, Judyth embraces it wholeheartedly. She claims that Shaw “represented Texas money in New Orleans.” Shaw is portrayed as a thoroughly cold-blooded fellow by Judyth. For example, it is he who is behind the trip to Jackson and Clinton. Lee and Judyth were heartsick over the plan to treat a prisoner/mental patient, but were powerless to stop it. Several days after the first trip, Lee took Judyth to the hospital to see the test subject. Shaw OK’d it, as he wanted her professional assessment of the patient’s condition. The test was a success, as the subject died within weeks. Lee and Judyth began to realize that they were trapped. They could not back out of the plot for fear they would be killed. . . . Based on a message from H.L. Hunt conveyed to a Shaw associate, those involved with the labs had reason to fear for their lives once they had outlived their usefulness. But Shaw apparently did have a compassionate side. According to Judyth’s account: At the end of August, Shaw paid for the last of several hotel trysts for Judyth and Lee. According to Judyth, Shaw felt sorry for them. Judyth adds some salacious details in an e-mail: And our feelings had been out of control for quite awhile now. We were so desperate we even slept together in a red van that was being overhauled in Adrian Alba’s garage for the City of New Orleans (or some such thing). We roasted – and almost got heat stroke doing that (funny now). That’s how Clay Shaw learned about our plight, that we needed a place to go. He arranged for us to have meetings in hotels, and the first week we got to do this was the week between July 27 and ending August 2 nd . It seems that Shaw, who didn’t mind the cold-blooded killing of a mental patient, couldn’t stand for a couple of adulterous lovers to lack a place to shack up! Judyth can’t pass up an opportunity to portray Shaw’s death as mysterious. She claims that “Clay Shaw died suddenly of cancer in 1972. . . . He was being treated for an undisclosed illness at Ochsner’s Hospital just prior to his death.” In fact, Shaw died after a long bout with cancer , not of any “undisclosed” illness. Judyth has also claimed that Guy Banister was killed by conspirators, saying that in the aftermath of the assassination “. . . everybody was so afraid. . . . . Banister holed up for months and quit his work entirely – they killed him (called it a heart attack, but my mafia friends tell me he had a bullet in him).” In reality, neither Banister’s death certificate nor the police report of his death mentions any bullet wound. “Deadly Alliance” continues: Of the 8 persons Judyth knew who were connected to the New Orleans cancer project, 5 were dead by 1967. After 1972, only she and Ochsner remained – and she was in hiding. This might seem sinister – unless of course the five dead people were not actually people Judyth knew, but rather got included in her story at least partly because they died “mysterious deaths.” Judyth cannot resist tying everything together, and she suggests that the “cocktail” that was intended for Castro got recycled: However, these [bioweapons] materials certainly didn’t vanish, and I suspect they were also involved in Jack Ruby’s death, perhaps Clay Shaw’s, and others.’ I would like to see a list of people involved in this case who died of lung cancer, especially if they did not smoke, such as Jack Ruby. And how many heart attacks (sodium morphate). As we have seen, the business about “sodium morphate” is scientific nonsense Judyth picked up from some Internet conspiracy web site. David Atlee Phillips No conspiracy theory would be complete without someone from the CIA, and one key suspect featured in many conspiracy books is David Atlee Phillips, a propaganda expert serving as chief of Cuban operations in Mexico City. To quote Judyth’s account: At a meeting arranged by Ochsner’s group, INCA, held to prepare for a radio interview of Lee, someone accidentally uttered the name “David Atlee Phillips.” Lee came to believe his CIA handler, “Mr. B.,” was actually Phillips. Judyth waited in the car as the meeting took place at Reily’s. Of course, this creates a huge problem, since Phillips was working at the Mexico City CIA station during the summer of 1963, and could hardly have been the handler of Lee Oswald in New Orleans. So the “outline” fudges a bit and admits “Mr. B may not have been Phillips.” Unfortunately for the sanitized version, we have an early version of a chapter of Judyth’s book titled “Before the Silence Came: Lee’s Last Telephone Calls.” One emotional passage reads as follows. I could hear him crying. We were in the very depths of hell. I couldn’t see, I couldn’t even stand. I leaned against the phone and cried, too. “Just go!” I urged him. “Get out – it’s too late to help him.” “Even if I wanted to, which I do not,” Lee said, his voice trembling, “I couldn’t. Not only me – they’d come after my family. They’d find you. You’d all die – ” What could I say? I knew it was true. “You just remember –,” Lee said, “David Atlee Phillips.” “I won’t forget.” “I’m going to get out alive,” Lee said, trying to choke back his emotions. “You’ll see – ” “Sure.” Thus Phillips is firmly present in the early version of Judyth’s story. She seems to have backed off when she – or some member of Team Judyth – noted the implausibility of Phillips as Lee’s “handler.” James Jesus Angleton Judyth has rather firmly insisted that Lee Oswald was sent to the Soviet Union as a “fake defector” at the behest of the CIA. The CIA person in charge of this supposed operation was James Jesus Angleton, fabled and controversial Chief of Counterintelligence. Oswald, at the time he defected to the Soviet Union, had applied to and been accepted at Albert Schweitzer College in Switzerland. According to Judyth: Lee told me he was told to “apply” there (without adding at this time other details I know), but that he had the choice of either destination, the college or Russia – he had been groomed to go into Russia so that eventually he could be sent into Cuba. Lee personally felt if he had chickened out of going to Moscow and decided to go to A.S. in Switzerland, instead, which was supposed to be his ‘choice,’ he felt he would have been eliminated by Angleton. This was one of the very few names Lee gave me, he did not trust this person Angleton, he worried a great deal how to get Angleton to stay off his back when he returned from his so-called defection, as others who returned were all under suspicion. He worked out a magnificent solution. I have details on what he did. Actually I brought up this person after that, only got the full name (James Jesus Angleton) much later after he commented more extensively on his return from Russia. I know I supposedly was not supposed to hear any of these names, but this is one that I DID hear. [Emphasis in original, capitalization corrected] No fake defector program has ever been discovered by scholars studying the CIA, even in the wake of a massive release of documents in the 1990s. But what is most bizarre about this is the notion that Oswald would have known Angleton’s actual name, rather than some alias. H.L. Hunt H.L. Hunt was a Texas oil millionaire, an extreme conservative, and thus, in the minds of many conspiracists, a likely plotter. We have already seen that Hunt supposedly passed a message to plotters in New Orleans making it clear that plot members who had “outlived their usefulness” would probably be killed. Judyth’s account explains the motivation of “Texas Money” in standard conspiracist terms: This group – led by H.L. Hunt – detested JFK’s Cuba policy, as well as his integrationist stance, but mostly they were threatened by his vow to repeal a major tax windfall, the oil depletion allowance. They wanted a man in the White House they could control, i.e., LBJ, and they needed to get him there fast, as the Bobby Baker and Billy Sol Estes scandals threatened his continuation as Vice President. Frank Ragano, Johnny Roselli Ragano was a lawyer who defended mobsters, and claimed to have relayed assassination orders from Jimmy Hoffa. Roselli was a mobster involved in CIA plots against the life of Castro. Judyth described the involvement of both men to researcher Rich DellaRosa. But DellaRosa came away skeptical. Quoting DellaRosa: We exchanged e-mails and at one point she rambled on about knowing Carlos Marcello and attorney Frank Ragano. Having met and spoken with Frank Ragano, I asked her some questions. She failed every one. I am certain that she did NOT know Ragano, and probably never knew Marcello either. She described Ragano as being tall and “looking like a movie star.” No offense to Frank, but he wasn’t tall and was a bit homely. I suggested that perhaps she meant Johnny Roselli. She replied that no, she also knew Roselli and it was Ragano who looked like a movie star. There were other things. Once she was aware that I had met Ragano, she never mentioned him again. [Emphasis in original] She would, apparently, have been prudent never to mention Roselli or Ragano in the first place. J. Edgar Hoover After the plot to kill Castro failed, the plotters turned to “Plan B,” the assassination of Kennedy. Oswald, according to Judyth: . . . had penetrated the assassination ring, and was in too deep to withdraw without retribution to his family, to me, and others whom he loved and cared about. He stood his ground and sent information to the FBI to the very last. But J. Edgar Hoover didn’t want Kennedy to live. JFK was going to force him to retire. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was Hoover’s next-door neighbor, literally, for years in Washington, made Hoover Director of the FBI for life when he came into office after JFK was murdered. It’s nice to know that Johnson was a good neighbor! But the most striking thing about this is that unless Lee was phoning Hoover directly, multiple people in the FBI chain of command would have had to know about the plot and conceal it, never going public with the explosive fact that the FBI had foreknowledge of the assassination. Other Sinister Characters The list above includes only the most central and best-known characters included in Judyth’s account. Also popping up are: William Reily – Owner of the Reily Coffee Company, who as part of the plot got Lee and Judyth their jobs. Reily, like Ochsner, was a member of INCA. Gerry Patrick Hemming – Former Marine who claims to have participated in a variety of covert military and paramilitary activities, and has in turn been fingered as an assassination plotter. Both his claims and accusations against him lack credibility. Herbert Philbrick – FBI informant in the Communist Party whose story was made into a TV series titled “I Led Three Lives.” This was a young Lee Oswald’s favorite TV show. Lee supposedly met Philbrick at an event sponsored by INCA, and was unimpressed. Jack Martin – Employee of Guy Banister who called reporters on the weekend of the assassination suggesting that David Ferrie might have taught Oswald how to shoot. As his story got better over the years, he placed Oswald in Banister’s office. Kerry Thornley – Friend of Lee’s in the Marine Corps, and incredibly an assassination suspect of Jim Garrison. Judyth says that he and Marina Oswald were carrying on an affair. Thornley was, in fact, not even in New Orleans at the time of the supposed affair. Carlos Quiroga – Anti-Castro Cuban in New Orleans. Alex Rorke – Anti-Castro activist lost in flight over Cuba in September 1963. Judyth claims she heard the name from Lee, and that it was “confirmed” by Ferrie. Antonio Veciana – member of a militant anti-Castro group, who claimed to have a CIA contact named “Maurice Bishop,” whom many conspiracists believe was David Atlee Phillips (see above). Sergio Arcacha Smith – Yet another anti-Castro Cuban, and a favorite conspiracy suspect because his group had an office at 544 Camp Street, the address that Oswald put on some of the leaflets he handed out in New Orleans. Both Smith and his group had been gone from 544 Camp for over a year by the time Oswald arrived in New Orleans. Layton Martens – roommate of Ferrie’s. Judyth says he knew her simply as “the girlfriend.” Francis Gary Powers – Pilot of the U-2 spy plane shot down by the Soviets in 1960. Judyth claims Lee told her he gave the Soviets information they needed for the successful interception. Judyth adds that “Without a doubt, Lee told me that he conversed with Gary Powers.” Richard Case Nagell – Mentally ill man whom conspiracy books claim got himself arrested a few weeks before the assassination because he knew of it and feared that he would be a patsy. George DeMohrenschildt – Lee’s friend, a man of extensive contacts and travels, who is routinely labeled a CIA agent by conspiracists. William Gaudet – man with some CIA connections who got the visa to go to Mexico immediately before Lee Oswald in 1963. In later years he started describing seeing Oswald with Ferrie and Banister on the streets in New Orleans. Bobby Baker, Billy Sol Estes – Associates of Lyndon Johnson, accused of corruption. Santos Trafficante – Mafia boss in Tampa. Judyth claims that David Ferrie called her almost two weeks after the assassination to inform her that Trafficante would be watching her, and that she was to keep a low profile. Janet Conforto (“Jada”) – a stripper recruited by Jack Ruby in New Orleans. Judyth “reveals” that she “was forced by the mob to go to Dallas, she did not go willingly . . . .” Ron Lewis – an author who wrote a book claiming to have been a friend of Oswald’s in the summer of 1963 in New Orleans. Lewis’ story is almost universally disbelieved among assassination buffs, and when Judyth discovered this she quickly dropped any mention of him. Roscoe White – Dallas cop who, years after his death, was accused by his wife and son of having shot Kennedy from the Grassy Knoll. In support of this claim, they eventually produced “cables” that instructed White to kill Kennedy. The story collapsed when the “cables” were determined to have been forged. White was a part of Judyth’s account early on, but she appears to have discovered that the story had problems, and began back peddling. Her manuscript fragment “Before the Silence Came” shows her backtracking, saying it was only an officer named “Rocky.” All of these people are discussed in conspiracy books – most in many conspiracy books. And Judyth claims “inside knowledge” about all of them, either from her personal experience, or via conversations with Lee or David Ferrie. DellaRosa summarized his contacts with her by saying that “Judyth came off like she was the Forrest Gump of the JFK case – that she came in contact with an incredible number of principals: Ruby, Ferrie, Garrison, Marcello, Roselli, and several others.” Judyth and the Paul Hoch Ratio Test Avid readers of conspiracy books are likely to favor accounts, like Judyth’s, that include a large number of familiar names. After all, they have read about how these people are “suspects” and are generally sinister people. The fact that there is “evidence” that they were involved in the plot renders credible any witness who provides a first-hand explanation of their role. Thus what they have read will appear to “corroborate” the witness – and vice versa. In fact, having too many familiar names an any account is the tipoff that the account is bogus. As researcher Paul Hoch put it: I suspect that a useful measure of the plausibility of an allegation could be derived from the percentage of well-known names. If a source claims to have met with David Ferrie, Allen Dulles, and Fidel Castro in Jack Ruby’s nightclub, I’ll go on to the next document. Any post-Garrison story with Clay Shaw in it starts with a heavy burden of skepticism to overcome. Hoch’s point is based on the unavoidable intuition that the vast majority of plotters fingered in conspiracy books must in fact be innocent – else a literal cast of thousands was involved in killing Kennedy. Further, it’s vastly implausible that anywhere near a majority of the real plotters have been identified. Thus accounts that include too many familiar names appear to have been drawn from conspiracy lore, and not real life experience. A corollary of the Hoch Ratio Test holds that an account is suspect when it includes few names of people who are still alive – and who might denounce the account or even sue for libel. Thus the fact that one’s roster of conspirators consists almost entirely of dead people doesn’t suggest a sinister “clean up squad” going around killing people off . Rather, it suggests a story concocted to be “safe” in a way that a story accusing live individuals of conspiring to murder the president can’t be. The Many Elements of Judyth’s Story Indeed, it’s sometimes clear that not merely names of people but stories of events and artifacts must have been drawn from conspiracy lore. Both the late Jean Hill and self-professed Grassy Knoll gunman James Files have claimed inside knowledge of the “changed parade route” that took Kennedy down Elm Street on the day of the assassination. Unfortunately for both, the parade route was never changed , and both claimed knowledge of events that could not have happened. With Judyth, one such element of her story concerns “Oswald’s Minox camera.” Judyth claims to have seen Lee with “an expensive Minox camera, typically used in espionage work.” And according to Judyth’s manuscript: The minutiae about the Minox and its film records are too detailed to go into here, but Lee had arranged with some officer to intercept the film before it reached the wrong hands, and to make sure that it would be kept in a safe place so that its contents, which may have included photos of the notes he wrote to the FBI, could be used to prove his innocence, should he be captured. That Lee owned a Minox camera is a staple of conspiracy books, and sounds quite “spooky” since the Minox is indeed used by spies . The Dallas police were convinced that they recovered a Minox camera among Oswald’s effects, and the fact that the FBI later insisted that they had recovered not a Minox camera but rather a Minox light meter makes this seem even more spooky, suggesting an FBI cover up. But the Dallas Police photo of the evidence they recovered shows no Minox camera, but rather a Minox light meter and an empty Minox case with a chain. Michael Paine owned a Minox, and rolls of Minox film recovered by the police were all shot by him. Thus Judyth’s story about Lee and his Minox appears to be another conspiracy book factoid that has gotten woven into the testimony of a “witness.” Judyth, apparently aware of the “light meter versus camera” issue, has claimed that (in the words of “Deadly Alliance” ) “Lee’s Minox was so sensitive that he never needed to use a light meter in her presence. She never saw him with one.” Any photography buff will recognize this as malarkey. In the first place, the Minox is not particularly “sensitive,” having an F:3.5 lens. Further the small negative size limits the ability to use (relatively grainy) high speed film. But worse, the things that render a camera “sensitive” to low light (large lens aperture, fast film) risk overexposure, so photographers using a large aperture lens and fast film need a light meter as much as anybody else. In an attempt to discredit the FBI’s “light meter” claim, Judyth appears to have invented a story that is photographic nonsense. Lee’s Trip to Irving On the evening before the assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald caught a ride to Irving, Texas so that he could talk with his wife Marina, who was living at the residence of Ruth Paine. According to Judyth, she talked to Lee Oswald on the previous evening (Wednesday), and Lee told her he was going to Irving to “say goodbye” to Marina and his two daughters. In reality, Lee pled with Marina to move to Dallas so that they could both live together in an apartment he would rent. Bill Greer’s Reaction to the Shooting When the shooting began in Dealey Plaza, Kennedy’s Secret Service driver William Greer did not accelerate the limousine, but instead slowed down. Conspiracists and lone gunman theorists differ as to whether this was sinister, but it clearly happened. Judyth weaves it into her account in the context of her last conversation with Lee. Lee told me that the driver’s habits had been studied, and a shot going off would cause him to brake, which would slow the vehicle down. This was desired because even this cabal feared Aristotle Onassis, who would send killers out to track down anyone who killed Jackie Kennedy, or so the rumor went – and besides, everybody liked Jackie and orders were out not to hit her. It was to spare Jackie that some very expert marksmen missed or delayed their shots that day in Dealey Plaza: she was in their line of sight a great deal of the time, according to David Ferrie, who got the report from Marcello’s henchmen as soon as he arrived in the Houston area. How anybody could have studied Bill Greer’s reactions to a shot without actually firing a weapon during a presidential motorcade is something Judyth doesn’t bother to explain. But doing that would, to say the very least, attract quite a lot of attention. Jack Ruby and Officer Tippit According to Judyth, Jack Ruby (whom she knew as “Sparky”) and Officer J.D. Tippit were friends. Judyth claims to have been in telephone contact with David Ferrie after the assassination, and . . . Dave told me that he still had a chance to get Lee out, and that he had only been connected so far with Officer Tippit’s death, which he believed was a total set-up. Tippit and Sparky, he said, were friends, and it was Tippit who was supposed to drive Lee to Red Bird airport. Unless Tippit turned out to be a traitor. Judyth here appears to be recycling an ancient factoid which dates back to Mark Lane’s claims to the Warren Commission. Jack Ruby most certainly did know an Officer Tippit, but it was a different Tippit, and not the cop shot in Oak Cliff less than an hour after the assassination. Red Bird airport has long been a part of conspiracy lore. The Visit of Adlai Stevenson to Dallas A few weeks before the assassination, U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson visited Dallas, and was treated roughly by noisy right-wing protestors. According to Judyth, Lee told her that he had himself egged on the protests, in hope that a row during the Stevenson visit would cause security during the JFK visit to be tightened. Judyth recounts a phone conversation she had with Lee. “I read about it in the paper,” I told him. “He was spit on. He was hit with some placards.” Lee in his conversations referred to JFK as “the Chief” – and he might also have used JFK’s code name, which I had forgotten, but have been told was ‘Lancer.’ “Better Stevenson getting bops on the head, than the Chief getting bullets in the head,” Lee told me. . . “Stevenson wasn’t in any real danger. I made sure of that.” Given Oswald’s amateurish and transparent effort to infiltrate Carlos Bringuier’s anti-Castro organization in New Orleans, it’s difficult to see how Oswald could do such a dandy job of infiltrating and manipulating right-wing elements in Dallas. Adding Details to the Story Weaving a story around the things written in conspiracy books is a bit dangerous: some of the “facts” in the resulting story might be demonstrably untrue. In contrast, writing about private, personal experiences might seem safer. If somebody claims to have had a conversation with Lee Oswald, how can anybody know what was said? Thus we find, in Judyth’s manuscript, a tearful exchange between her and Lee Oswald on the Wednesday before the assassination: Because time was so short now, Lee told me there wouldn’t be another call from him unless he reached Laredo. “Lee,” I said slowly, “you didn’t say until. You said ‘unless.’” “I apologize,” he answered. I heard him suck up his breath. We were both very close to tears. Outside, it was sunset. “You’ll go to Cancun,” Lee said. “You’ll stay in a fine hotel. I’ll be there — if they – “ We were both speechless. “You know,” he said then, “if I don’t make it out— you have to go on with everything.” “Oh, sure!” I said, bitterly. I told him that I would never allow anyone to replace him in my heart. Thus Lee and Judyth were to meet in Cancun – or Judyth was to go there if Lee failed to escape – and stay in a “fine hotel.” Unfortunately, there were no fine hotels in Cancun in 1963. The popular vacation destination has been developed since, and the place was a series of deserted sand dunes in 1963. Furious Backtracking When Team Judyth became aware of this problem, they did some quick footwork. First, they explained that it wasn’t really Judyth who said that, but rather it was put in the manuscript by coauthor Howard Platzman. Judyth also claimed an interest in anthropology, and asserted that she was interested in Mayan ruins in the area. The first problem with this is that even an anthropological interest in this area isn’t plausible. The claim that the “Cancun” business was put in by Platzman was quickly replaced by the claim that Judyth’s “first agent” had added a bunch of nonsensical material to the manuscript. Supposedly, the version of the final chapter that was leaked (and appears on this web site) was a “partially corrected” version that somehow still had Cancun left in. The individuals to whom the chapter was sent were told nothing about it being “partially corrected.” Indeed, it would be foolish to distribute a draft before corrections were complete. Judyth also told David Lifton (in a phone conversation) and Mary Ferrell that she was to meet Lee in Cancun. Neither account includes “fine hotel,” but neither does either mention Mayan ruins. But the story gets more convoluted. Talking on Black Op Radio , Judyth described her “first book.” I was terrified . . . I was scared . . . I wrote a bunch of nonsense because I didn’t want to get sued. All I wanted to do was to get some publishers interested in my story and then I would give them the other book, which by the way a number of people saw my original book . . . it’s not what was put out there to begin with, that was I guess you would call it a “teaser” I put that out there to try to get interest. . . . ( click here to listen to the clip, and forward to about the 6:07 mark.) How this “nonsense” version got replaced by a “good” version which was handed over to the agent to be edited back into a “nonsense” version which was then sent out before it was fully “corrected” is something of a mystery. To further complicate matters, Judyth has admitted to lacing the manuscript with further disinformation. As she explained in an e-mail to Dave Reitzes: The book has what I call “flags” in them [sic]. A couple of us have the true version, and the other version has some things in it that will keep it from getting pirated. Judyth, in fact, claims to have put thirty untrue statements in the manuscript. Supposedly, if the manuscript is stolen, one or more of the “flags” will reveal who stole or leaked it. Thus she has all kinds of excuses for why various versions of her story are filled with malarkey. It’s because she was scared, or because her agent put it in there, or because it’s a “flag” intended to frustrate piracy. All these might seem to give her enough wiggle room to wiggle out of “fine hotel in Cancun.” But the comments at the head of the chapter say nothing about it being “partially corrected,” and indeed state “the next section will deal with the last two telephone calls====thanks.j.” This appears for all the world to be Judyth’s introduction to material she has written. Even worse, Judyth herself e-mailed the draft with “Cancun” and “fine hotel” to several people, including her “coauthor” Howard Platzman. In the e-mail she says: Dear Howard and all: I am resending the “end of line” realizing it isn’t quite finished – it doesn't have a goodbye, for example, from Lee, no hang-up – I really couldn’t go there. . . . I went over the attached file and it’s a little better than the earlier version now, so please just delete the earlier version, unless you want to compare them and see how my memory gets contaminated! The only police names I ever heard was “unusual name” Tippit, a “Rocky,” and somebody called “Wayne” – and that’s it. File attached.....thanks everyone for your patience, this has been hard to finish. j In one of my emails that you might have, I also described some of the last phone call. it lasted a little shorter than the others, probably forty-five minutes, I’d guess. I’d like a copy, since I lost hundreds of emails, apparently to a hacker. So if you come across it, thanks for sending it along. It has a partial reconstruction of the phone call, and there is something I might have rendered a little better there. As you know, these conversations are reconstructions as best as I can recall them. . . . And of course, I do remember the gist of it all. Ok, that's all, folks. [File extracted: ENDofLINE.doc] Indeed, I hope that “end of line” will have the same effect on the house of cards that was constructed, that a similar end-of-line scenario had in the movie TRON! love from judyth [minor spelling and capitalization errors corrected] The file attached to the e-mail is the precise draft included on this site , with the only change being a conversion to Acrobat .PDF format for web reading. So “Cancun” together with “fine hotel” was in a version that Judyth explicitly said she wrote, and which she e-mailed to several people. Not surprisingly, her most recent account entirely omits Cancun and “Mayan ruins.” In “The Men Who Killed Kennedy” she claims that she and Lee were to escape to Mérida, a town on the Yucatan Peninsula (a two-hundred-mile drive from present-day Cancun) because it was a place “that had CIA contacts located there.” Where Did it Come From? Judyth’s story appears to have come from a variety of sources. People familiar with the JFK assassination literature may notice a distinct similarity between Judyth’s account and a story told by Ed Haslam in a book titled Mary, Ferrie, and the Monkey Virus . The Haslam book plays on the notion, taken seriously in some quarters, that the AIDS virus was concocted in a secret government lab. Judyth’s supporters insist that the Haslam account is “corroboration” of Judyth’s story. But the first edition of the Haslam book came out in 1995, years before Judyth began to tell her tale. How does Team Judyth know that her account is independent of Haslam’s? Because she told them it was. Judyth in “The Men Who Killed Kennedy” To believe that Haslam and Baker are giving two independent corroborating accounts, it’s necessary to believe that something this implausible might really have happened. If it didn’t happen, Judyth’s account must be derived from Haslam’s. Judyth clearly got one piece of nonsense from Haslam. She points out that Mary Sherman was murdered on July 21, 1964, and says this was the day “when the Warren Commission came to get her testimony. . . . They killed her the same day. You can imagine how many people wouldn’t even say a word after that.” In fact, the Warren Commission didn’t even know that Mary Sherman existed. She entered the world of conspiracy theorizing due to Jim Garrison’s investigation. Haslam pointed out the coincidence of dates in a 1996 article, and Judyth repeated it, upping the ante with a claim that the Warren Commission was going to interview Sherman. Judyth’s inclusion of David Atlee Phillips as Oswald’s CIA “handler” apparently stems from something Luis Urrea, one of her English professors, told her. Urrea had been told by Sean Phillips, nephew of David Atlee Phillips, that the latter made a deathbed confession of having been Oswald’s Mexico City handler. Urrea passed that information along to Judyth, without necessarily vouching for its accuracy, and was a bit surprised when it appeared in her account. Researchers who were in contact with Team Judyth have added their bit of spice to the soup. For example in August 2000 one of them reported to Team Judyth “information” that David Ferrie had collected toys for a Christmas toy drive organized by Dr. Mary Sherman. When Judyth talked to Black Op Radio in 2004, she reported that Ferrie and Sherman had met during Sherman’s big toy drive. Judyth and Garrison Judyth says she first watched the movie “JFK” in 1998, and became moved to “tell her story.” So it’s not surprising that many on Judyth’s list of plotters seem to have come from the Garrison investigation. Judyth implicates Clay Shaw, the man Garrison tried for the murder of Kennedy. Anti-Castro Cubans figured prominently in his thinking, as did Banister and Ferrie. But many of her plotters aren’t found on the movie “JFK,” and she appears to have done considerable reading on the assassination. Ochsner and Reily were Garrison suspects and the DA was, at one time, close to arresting both of them. His only evidence against them was that they were anti-Communist activists. Garrison suspected Mary Sherman, whom he believed had a sinister link with Ferrie. Garrison even thought Kerry Thornley was a suspect, mostly on the basis of Warren Commission testimony that portrayed Oswald in an unfavorable light . Including the Mob One set of plotters who were not Garrison suspects were the mobsters. The Orleans Parish district attorney quite conspicuously ignored the Mafia in this “investigation.” Judyth remedies this defect by adding them to the mix. But she also provides an explanation for his steering clear of the mob. Garrison, Judyth explains, carried on a sexual relationship with an hermaphrodite stripper named Sandra Sexton and was “compromised” since the Marcello organization knew about it. In an e-mail she sent to a researcher, she elaborated on this theme: Sandra had silicone implants, which supposedly conveniently gave trouble about the time, I think, that Garrison needed her in town the least. Off s/he went to New York, and though s/he was a famous attraction, Mac [McCullough] said he never saw Sandra again and wonders if s/he is still alive. I think Sandra wisely hid itself . . As others of us did. S/he supposedly cared for Garrison. Sandra worked in The Five Hundred Club but I think I remember independently that s/he also worked in the one across the street to start with, then came top billing, and a “room at the top” on second floor at The Five Hundred Club, where Garrison most likely, by the way, was not the only client. This exotic dancer was idolized by many a man who did not know the anatomical peculiarities as Garrison had to know them, despite operations and implants. Admit I smile at thinking about the film JFK and Jim Garrison’s true “family matters.” General Reliability Judyth has a demonstrated tendency to inflate her importance and accomplishments. One example of this is her foray into dog breeding. Before she moved to the Netherlands in early 2003, she was a breeder of the “American Cream Dog.” Quoting her own description of the breed: The American Cream is a rare breed of dog developed for Guide and service and Canine Companion use. ACPBA [American Cream Puppy Breeders Association] headquarters is in Palmetto, LA, near the University of SW Louisiana, where their high intelligence is under study. Her web page on this “breed” is, at this writing, still visible on the Internet . It claims: They are beautiful dogs. Clean, intelligent, wise. They are a new breed of dog, developed to be a special companion for home and family, and for every stage of human life. They were created in honor of an unrecognized American patriot. The “unrecognized American patriot” is Lee Harvey Oswald. She goes on to explain that her dogs: Have been tested in psycholinguistics experiments at University of Louisiana. One learned American Sign language. Another dog named “Susan” she explains, “has been tested to know more than 250 words.” What was the ancestry of this dog? It traces back to a mutt that Judyth brought back to the United States after living briefly in Norway. Of course, established breeds of dogs are typically cross-breeds from existing stock, but a legitimate breed must go through several generations so that it will “breed true.” The American Kennel Club does not recognize the American Cream Dog. When some Internet newsgroup posters who are dog lovers first noticed Judyth’s web page about her new “breed,” they proceeded to caustically trash the whole idea . Judyth has been willing to engage in some chicanery to support her claims about her dogs. On one occasion she and several other students were in the home of Professor Urrea, for an informal seminar meeting. Judyth profusely praised the American Cream dog she had brought along, touting the breed’s intelligence. As the seminar progressed the dog was on the floor next to her, and she surreptitiously reached down and unfastened the dog’s collar. As the dog bounded free, she enthused over how smart it was to escape the collar. But both Urrea’s wife and Urrea himself observed her releasing the dog. Judyth As Mormon Scholar Judyth joined the Mormon Church with her husband in 1969, and for several years seemed to prosper in the church. She said that she: . . . [r]ose through Mormon ranks and met most of its leaders – very hard to do – and got inside the machinery of that religion, being a state and regional official in different areas of function, including publicity and achieving [sic] historian. What I wrote became the final version of the church’s history of its members and its official activities in a wide section of Texas. Can I recount historical events accurately? Mormon Apostles, Stake Presidents and Bishops thought so. Yet she eventually became disillusioned. She posted the story of her disillusionment on an Internet web page , in response to another post about Mormonism. My dear friend, you have just hit the tip of the iceberg. I was a Mormon in high places for ten years in a seventeen year long membership. The church evolves. What any dead prophet ever said is never considered as “true” as what a living prophet says. In this manner, the church has not built upon a solid foundation, but upon Swiss cheese. The church is filled with good people, but they are being led by men who well know the true history and teachings of the church, which are in direct conflict with many ideas and doctrinal interpretations being dished out today. If the foundation is rotten, this house will not stand. I was a regional publicity director and historian in the church. I left the church because, having studied ancient Egyptian as a linguist for over a decade, I could no longer condone that Joseph Smith had translated ANYTHING correctly from “Egyptian” in the Book of Abraham. I had Hugh Nibley, the church’s ex officio Egyptian and Semitic language specialist, contradic [truncated in original, spelling and capitalization corrected, emphasis in original] The Book of Abraham was a “translation” of an ancient Egyptian manuscript produced by the founder of Mormonism, Joseph Smith and was claimed by Smith to supply new information about Abraham of the Old Testament, father of the Jews. In fact, the manuscript had nothing to do with the biblical Abraham, and Smith simply concocted a fanciful story and claimed it to be a translation . But would Judyth need to study ancient Egyptian, and be an historian in the Mormon Church to determine this? The “Book of Abraham” was debunked in the 1860s. Quoting from Fawn Brodie’s fine biography of Joseph Smith, No Man Knows My History , pp. 174-175: Moreover, the [ Book of Abraham ] laid Joseph open to the ridicule of future scholars, for his papyri were almost certain to be examined at some later date by experts in the Egyptian language. Unlike the golden plates [of the Book of Mormon ], which had been whisked back into heaven, the mummies and papyri were kept on exhibit in both Kirtland and Nauvoo. The actual papyri escaped scholarly examination for many years. After Joseph’s death they were sold by a friend of William Smith to the Wood museum and were thought to have burned in the great Chicago fire. Such a disaster might have ended all chance of exposing Joseph’s mistake had he not preserved three facsimiles of the papyri, which he published in 1842 with elaborate interpretations. These interpretations were first challenged in 1860, when a French traveler, Jules Remy, who had become interested in the Mormons, called them to the attention of the Coptic student Theodule Deveria in the Louvre. Remy arranged the two strikingly divergent interpretations in parallel columns and published them in 1861 in his A Journey to the Great Salt-Lake City . Later the half-dozen leading Egyptologists who were asked to examine the facsimiles agreed that they were ordinary funeral documents such as can be found on thousands of Egyptian graves. So did Judyth, in the 1980s, finally figure out that the Book of Abraham was bogus? Was she entirely oblivious to all the writings critical of Smith’s work? Even assuming that she was insulated from non-Mormon sources, had she never come across the definitive scholarly translation of the papyri published in Dialogue: a Journal of Mormon Thought in the Summer of 1968? Note that Judyth claims to have been important in Mormon circles, to have been a church historian, and to have met church “bigwigs.” Yet she told W. Tracy Parnell that she was the first “Mormon in good standing” to “confront the Mormon church with findings 100% at odds with the so-called ‘translation’ by Joseph Smith of the Book of Abraham papyrus.” She also claims to have studied the papyri as part of her “anthropology honors thesis.” Did she “reinvent the wheel” as the result of her great linguistic talent, or did she claim credit for a discovery that had been made a century before she ever became a Mormon? The former is about as plausible as finding an “A” student in a college calculus class who can’t do long division. Interestingly, Team Judyth has never tried to substantiate her fluency in ancient Egyptian. Judyth and Bertrand Russell Not only does Judyth involve a very large cast of Americans in her saga, she also includes Britisher Bertrand Russell. Russell was one of the great philosophers of the 20 th century, although by the 1960s he was very old, bitter, and virulently anti-American. But Judyth’s interest in him seems to have been more personal than political. According to Mary Ferrell: She claims she wrote to Bertrand Russell about her reluctance to have sex with Lee because she and he were both married at the time. She says that Russell wrote to her that she must not let anything hold her back if they were in love. They must have sex. Russell’s papers do indeed contain a letter that Judyth wrote to Russell. Unfortunately for Judyth’s story, it is dated May 19, 1968, almost five years after her extramarital affair with Lee began. On November 8, 2000, this writer posted a message describing the contents of her letter on the Internet newsgroup alt.assassination.jfk . Two days later, Judyth e-mailed several people with an “explanation” of her correspondence with Russell. I first wrote Lord Bertrand Russell in early 1962, after receiving a telegram from the entertainment mogul Arthur Godfrey, who contacted the Damon Runyon Foundation. Lord Russell heard of me from a member of the foundation and sent me an encouraging note about my cancer research. . . . In early 1964, I wrote again, this time asking him to destroy both that first letter and a letter that had been sent to him from New Orleans in May, 1963, by the “FPCC.” (Lee, me, Dave Ferrie, and two Cubans, one named Carlos, had all signed the letter – this terrified me in early 1964). I told him in this January, 1964 letter that I had been forced to leave the medical field, and was even forced to stay married, to keep my maiden name unknown, for having personally associated with the accused assassin. I added that I feared for my life. I also told him that Lee was innocent. Lord Russell kindly sent me a reply, a real letter, a few weeks later, saying he routinely destroyed all letters such as the politically dangerous one written to him, and that I must do the same, since many people considered him a communist. He agreed that Lee was innocent and said nobody in Europe thought he had done it. He then gave me advice that ended with “Live! Death is when you cease to die!” which I later incorporated into a poem. Four years later, ten days before giving birth to a daughter . . . I wanted to cheer Lord Russell, as I heard he was quite ill. I believed it was now safe to write again, at last.. So I did, reminding him of his positive impact on my life. His secretary eventually sent me an letter that Lord Russell expressed regret that he was too ill to write to me. I still own that reply. Judyth’s attempt to explain away the fact that the documents in the Russell papers don’t support her story has several problems. In the first place, she claims to have saved a letter from Russell’s secretary. But she failed to keep the letter from Russell himself, which was supposedly “too dangerous.” Yet she claims to have kept writing samples from Lee Harvey Oswald. Much worse, the 1968 letter she sent to Russell makes no mention of any previous correspondence. Instead, she thanks him profusely for his published works. There seems to be a sharp conflict between Judyth’s current story, and the documents in the archive. This appears to be another example of her taking a scrap of material out of her old belongings and concocting an elaborate tale around it, like the letters from important people that recognized her achievements in science (but supposedly show that nefarious plotters had taken notice of her), and bus transfers which show she took the bus to work (but which supposedly show that she rode to work with Lee Oswald). My Dog Ate the Evidence If Judyth doesn’t have any solid evidence to connect her to Oswald, she has lots of excuses. Consider, again, her green glass. It supposedly contained a note from Lee, which she kept with the glass. But her daughter threw it away, not thinking that it was valuable. As Judyth explains: Yes, Jack Ruby knew about the Green Glass because that was one of the excuses used to finally fire Lee. These green tea glasses on crystal pedestals were included as premiums in large boxes of tea. They were inserted just before the boxes were closed by a machine on the packing line. One of Lee’s jobs was to oil the packing rollers, etc. . . . I can prove I know the packing and shipping back there and what Lee was doing. He actually reached into a box and got me a green glass over an altercation where I should have been given a glass and was not, so he ‘stole’ one from a box as they were being sealed. Because nobody knew which box it was and they couldn’t reopen the boxes, the line boss was really angry at Lee for doing this, and this last report ended up being used as one of the reasons to bring his name up once more for termination. Because Lee was ready to leave, he didn’t care about this infraction anyway – he knew he was going to be terminated soon so that he could be more openly pro-Castro, an impossibility while working at Reily’s. I kept the glass, which also had a note Lee had written kept inside it (another part of the story) which my daughter observed but, not knowing it was valuable, tossed away only five years ago when we were packing our best glassware for moving. I had told her to be careful with the glass but had forgotten to tell her to keep the paper inside it. However, she does remember the note was in there and dated from 1963. It was a “fake receipt” which Lee created in the back room so I would not be in trouble for having the glass, with no obvious box of tea, at my half-desk. So my children knew the green glass was from Lee, but didn’t even know who he really was, as I NEVER spoke of this matter. So she threw the note away. She remembered doing it and has apologized. What kids do! (which is why I basically kept everything tucked away just so things like that would not happen! She did not know who “Lee H. Oswald” really WAS, she hadn’t thought about it. I am too tired to write more at present and hope this helps assuage your curiosity. ===j== [spelling, punctuation, and capitalization corrected, emphasis in original] So her daughter threw out the “note” that looked just like a receipt. She did it because she didn’t know who Lee Harvey Oswald “really was” and “she hadn’t thought about it.” Circa 1997, when this supposedly happened, her daughter was grown, and it’s hard to believe she didn’t know the name of the most famous assassin/patsy in all of American history. That Lee would steal a glass from a packing line, when whole pallets of glasses doubtless resided in some storeroom at Reily, is odd. And of course the Warren Commission, and numerous researchers since, have examined Lee’s firing at Reily and found no evidence whatsoever that the theft of a green glass had anything to do with it. Then there is this, from an e-mail written in September 2000, to explain the “disappearance” of other evidence. About this time last year, my former landlord, a drug addict, stole my diary, some jewelry and other things. He stole valuables from the other two trailers he also owned, at the same time, and the police were on their way. So he built a bonfire – under my window – and burned the evidence – probably what happened to the diary that had four pages from 1963 in it – before he was taken off to jail anyway – and of course, seeking a more secure habitat, at the urging of my good friends, I moved into the most secure – and nicest – apartment complex available here, even though it’s pricey for me. . . So she would have a diary showing contemporaneous mention of her affair with Oswald and perhaps her role in the assassination plot, but the drug addict landlord of her trailer park home burned it. Team Judyth has pointedly ignored questions about whether they ever sought a police report that could confirm this incident. Judyth gave a similar account to a researcher Louis Girdler, and According to Girdler: I asked for the same thing when she told me her “apartment” was burgled. When I asked for a cc of the police report [which she would need for an insurance claim], she admitted that it was her neighbor’s apartment that was broken into – but (she added quickly) her “window screen had been cut.” Judyth has all kinds of excuses for why absolutely critical evidence isn’t available. For example, in one e-mail she gave an extended account of her preservation of “evidence.” We’ve been accumulating NEW AND SUPPORTING evidence for a year and a half. That’s because people are being asked about me. They were not asked before. And others are finding evidence nobody knew to hunt for before. But long before that – for three and a half decades, in fact – I have never let the evidence be out of my possession, and it has always been at my side whenever I entered or left any country (as an anthropologist – B.S. degree in anthropology, with additional graduate hours and lots of field work – and as the wife of a geologist-mathematician, I have lived out of country and also traveled extensively ) . [ . . . ] 5) I HAVE FULL DOCUMENTATION FOR ALL MY ASSOCIATIONS WITH LEE HARVEY OSWALD, INCLUDING SOME PERSONAL ITEMS AND HIS HANDWRITING. 6) For thirty-seven years, carried THE EVIDENCE everywhere. Even to Norway and back, by plane. Even to Mexico, lived an entire summer there. I carried the evidence in my suitcase, never out of my sight at any time, when moving. THAT is the kind of evidence it is. There was no rummaging through attics for it.[emphasis in original] OK, so Judyth has all the “evidence” – including things such as the “green glass” (see above) with her. But there is one class of evidence she was much less careful with. I DID NOT CONSIDER LEE’S HANDWRITING AS EVIDENCE FINDING LEE’S HANDWRITING I have a library of books, some of which are on display in my living room. Many more are in boxes. My daughter, Sarah, has rummage through all my books. She or another of my five children even took the book Lee wrote in to school and put yellow magic marker underscoring in it! That’s how useless I thought Lee’s handwriting would be – because there was no signature. I am just glad the book wasn’t lost or damaged more than it was. The other books where Lee had written marginal comments was in bad shape, though. It [sic] had been badly chewed by puppies (the box of books had been on the big porch where the puppies were kept, as part of a barrier, and they chewed through the box one day and dragged out these paperback books) . . . (I had raised guide dog puppies and canine companion puppies, that’s why there were puppies on my porch).[spelling and capitalization corrected, headings capitalized in original.] So Judyth would have more samples of Lee’s handwriting – if her dogs hadn’t chewed up the books that contained them. Victim of Harassment? Judyth is, as of this writing, living in the Netherlands, supposedly driven out of the U.S. by “harassment.” She has claimed: I lost my job for speaking out. I was hounded, harassed, made fun of. But I will never waver, even though I am now forced to live in a foreign country where I have been kindly treated. And: I’m over here because I was threatened, harassed, followed . . . my life was made miserable in the United States just because I started talking. What was the precise nature of the harassment? According to Martin Shackelford (1.) a friend’s home filled with piles of excrement, requiring the family to move out of the house, (2.) a white van which began to show up wherever Judyth was, and which was seen (and identified as the same van each time) by neighbors, (3.) firing from a teaching job as a result of a campaign organized by an FBI employee who didn’t want their child taught by “a friend of Lee Harvey Oswald,” and (4.) ransacking of Judyth’s home and disappearance of some Oswald-related materials (fortunately only copies). Needless to say, Team Judyth has not verified the accuracy of any of this. Why conspirators would put excrement in the house of Judyth’s friend, rather than in Judyth’s own home, is difficult to understand, and the obvious conclusion is that her friend had enemies or was the victim of an act of random vandalism. The “white van” is also claimed by Judyth to have harassed her friend Debbee and her sister: My sister and Debbee – who has been spending significant time at Dallas archives public library, where they let her, she says, have only one file at a time, are upset again because they were again being followed by a white van. This time there was a satellite dish of some kind on top of the roof, they said. Anyway, I told them to write an affidavit and get it notarized. Judyth’s problems with white vans appear to go beyond mere harassment, however. In a rather irate post on the Internet newsgroups, she said that: ALTHOUGH I AM QUITE ILL AT PRESENT DUE TO BEING STRUCK BY A PERSON DRIVING A WHITE VAN WHO CANNOT PRESENTLY BE LOCATED, THE NAME OF ‘JUDYTH VARY BAKER’ HAS ALWAYS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH GOOD DEEDS AND HONEST REPORTAGE IN THE PAST. I WILL NOT ALLOW MY GOOD NAME TO BE CARELESSLY SULLIED BY OTHERS. [capitalization in original] People who have talked at some length to Judyth usually come away with a list of implausible tales she has told them. Robert Harris, for example, talked to her for three hours on the phone, and exchanged some e-mails. Judyth told him that somebody stole the hard drive out of her computer. They didn’t steal the entire computer, which would have been easier and would give the appearance of a routine robbery. No, they apparently wanted to save her the expense of buying a whole new computer! Judyth has repeatedly claimed to have gotten death threats. And she told Robert Harris that (in Harris’ words): She was on a flight which had to make an emergency stop in St. Louis, due to a passenger having a heart attack. A sinister looking character sitting near her, said, “If we can do that to him, think what we can do to you.” Given the ruthlessness of these supposed plotters, why they would stage an elaborate tableau to intimidate Judyth rather than simply killing her is a huge mystery. Judyth, in fact, has constantly claimed harassment from sinister people supposedly out to silence her. In an e-mail sent to several people on October 4, 2000, she gave a more interesting variation on the “hard drive” story she told Harris. As my confidence in [Joe] Riehl grew, finally showed him some of the original manuscript, which was afraid [sic] every moment would be stolen (he finally got a truncated version of it to read), as at that same time, my office got broken into etc. I had very stupidly gone to the CIA website trying to find the old code names I remembered, I was hunting for “MEDEC-ZOA” and for “ZOE” and “ZIM” – from that time, the trouble started, with hard drives in English Dept. where I wrote the book being stolen. Until nobody would let me use the English dept’s computers, for though I am “a student,” I am also an instructor there, moving close to ABD of the PhD. [spelling, capitalization, and punctuation corrected] At the time this was written, easily-accessible web pages about Judyth included one on the subject of short stories , and another promoting her “American Cream Dog.” She also had a web page at the University of Southwest Louisiana, so it’s difficult to believe the CIA needed to wait for her to access their web page in order to find her. But the most impressive high-tech form of surveillance/harassment was not against Judyth herself, but against Debbee and her sister Lynda. Judyth titled an e-mail to several supporters “Subject: my sister is being harassed, and so am I; confidential to my closest allies . . . .” She then quoted her sister: . . . when debbee would say a certain word that they would “key in” on, the phone would go dead for a moment and then return. debbee put her son-in-law and her mother on the phone, and they each would say the same words as well, and each time the phone would go dead on them as well, and then return. some of the words were ..28 days, monkey virus, ruby, cia, fbi, protection, thelma and louise, body, ignore, and a few others i can’t recall at this time. during all of this, and during one of the times there was dead air on my end, debbee said “too bad, 2 days” to me. i asked her why she said that, and that is when she told me there was dead air on her end of the line, and she did not say anything but “hello..are u still there”. i told her it was her voice and sounded just like she had said it without any hesitation. this is a concern, because it tells me someone wanted us to know either for our own good, or for not so good reasons that they are not only recording our conversations, but are able to quickly “play back” their altered version as to make it sound as though we are saying something we never said. i hope u are able to follow this...it’s hard to explain it very clearly...but u can understand why i won’t contact u by phone until this is over. i love u very much, honey. please tell h i am also getting hang up calls...it’s been going on all month at different times of the day. u will know this is your sis...just in case u aren’t sure....remember how our dad would sign off on his ham radio? 73’s and 88’s. write back and let me know u got this ok. i will wait for your reply. all my love, lynda. [as written, all errors in original] So it seems some sinister forces not only were listening in on phone conversations, they had the ability to alter transmissions in real time! But at other times, according to Judyth, the phone tapping was ludicrously inept. In an article in a Dutch magazine, the author gives the following account: During her many telephone conversations she got the impression that she was being listened to. During one of the conversations she heard two unknown people on the line at the same time. The one said to the other that they had to end Baker’s life, whereupon the other one told the first one that he should be quiet because people could hear them. That affected her. She had already been threatened several times, and had been attacked and seriously wounded. The feeling of insecurity became too much for her, and she decided to flee from America. She thought that living abroad would bring her less danger. Although Judyth, as we have already seen, believes that many people have been killed to conceal the plot, somehow the plotters have, rather than killing her, been content merely to harass her, and to do so in rather ham-handed ways. Fired Because of Her Friendship With Oswald? The final supposed act of “harassment” she has suffered is “firing from a teaching job as a result of a campaign organized by an FBI employee who didn’t want their child taught by ‘a friend of Lee Harvey Oswald.’” One has to wonder if it happened exactly that way, and in the wake of the airing of “The Men Who Killed Kennedy” a former student of hers came on the History Channel discussion board to give his version: Let me just tell you that I am 18 and a senior in high school. Mrs. Baker, Judyth, was hired at my school last year as our english teacher. What a mistake it turned out to be. She never taught us, she just went on about her “stories” which we all claimed were lies and that she needed to be cooped up somewhere. She was crazy because every time she heard a “loud noise” she would act like she was having a seizure in the classroom. Our school realized the mistake and fired her after a month and a half. (Post by Paulio, dated 7:55PM PST Nov 19, 2003). Bogus Claim of Asylum Claiming persecution in the U.S., Judyth left for the Netherlands, Hungary, and finally ended up in Sweden. She then announced that she had been given asylum there. If true, that would show the Swedish government endorsing her claim of political persecution. Unfortunately for Judyth, a Swedish researcher named Glenn Viklund had both the language skills and the skills researching his country’s bureaucracy to check out her story. Viklund dissects her claims in this essay . Of course, anybody can post anything on a web discussion board, but Team Judyth member Martin Shackelford responded and admitted that “Paulio” was the son of the sinister “FBI employee” who supposedly “got her fired.” Judyth’s “Boring Life” Judyth’s claims seem almost endless. When David Lifton accused her of concocting the story of her role in an assassination plot in order to make her boring life more interesting, she responded with an e-mail sarcastically titled “My Boring Life.” The missive outlines a very interesting life indeed! She claims, for example: At the same time [1966], was marching for peace, writing for underground newspapers, and got arrested by the FBI in a raid for writing subversive material, against the vietnam war, but we were all let go (my family knows about this from day One) . . . marched and supported Cesar Chavez sometime in the next few years, too . . . one of my anti-war friends was shot and thrown into a freezer. It was Texas, after all. [ellipses in original] She goes on to claim that as a reporter she got Mafia bordellos raided, and uncovered the Mafia headquarters in the Houston region. She further claims to “[h]ave painted portraits of racehorses for millionaires and advised surgeons in New York hospitals how to stop abdominal adhesions from forming.” Impressive for someone with no medical training. Further, Also broke up a witch’s coven and uncovered its head warlock. Sent police and a Mormon bishop to rescue, I am not kidding, a crippled virgin from their midst, Judy Devries, who was going to be burned alive in a telephone booth. My family will verify this, too. Happened on Hazard St. near the Diablo Club in Houston. Admittedly, not many people have rescued a crippled virgin from a witch’s coven. And especially not one who was about to be burned alive in a telephone booth! The fact that Judyth’s story bears a distinct resemblance to the famous parody college entrance essay is only the beginning of the problem. Many of these events occurred at a time when “Deadly Alliance” claims that Judyth was “in hiding” – living in fear that she would become yet another of those untimely deaths. Indeed, she claimed in an e-mail that: I did not speak out for many years because I was afraid. Oh, yes, I knew what would happen if my roles had been known. I even plucked my eyebrows to make them thin instead of as thick as before (I had posed as Marina Oswald . . .). Likewise, she claims to have been forced out of medical research by fear. In short, I was accidentally allowed to learn much more than probably originally was intended, and that’s also why – after the events of Nov. 22, 1963 – that I found myself constrained to leave medical research behind, if I wanted to stay alive. It is as simple as that. And in another e-mail (discussing herself in the third person) she claimed: In the end, Lee Oswald was murdered for his part in penetrating the assassination ring he had joined in hopes of destroying. Judyth, liked by Marcello, was spared IF she would keep her mouth shut and withdraw from the medical community. Judyth complied. . . . There was no opportunity to reveal such a complex matter in late November, 1963. . . . Ochsner would deny all, and the CIA – which did not want its activities with the mafia exposed – would have quickly moved in – or have the mafia move in – to shut her mouth. She had been warned that she would be killed. Of course she removed herself from her medical career – quite suddenly – deeply disappointing her family (her new husband never noticed) – and did not even get a degree in ANYTHING for twenty-five years. [Emphasis in original] Yet she is, in her response to Lifton, claiming to have been very visible, an activist, and pretty much “in the face” of both the Mafia and Federal authorities. If Judyth currently has two contradictory accounts of her life in the years following the assassination, one wonders what a source from those years would show. Indeed, such a source exists, in the letter she wrote to Bertrand Russell (see above). In the letter, she says: Today I am handsomely married! We love each other, but it would all have been ruined if, six years ago, I had not chucked the silly moral tic-tac-toes for reality, via your counsels. We will try to be so good to our coming child. Further, today I am an artist and hope to become a good writer – though still interested in science, I realize my limitations in that field despite the prestige it might have accorded me – and have avoided a career in same. I am politically active, even though frightened at the cost of this, since the United States powers-that-be are increasingly punitive in their outlook on such things as student dissent and assembly, to say nothing of their attitudes, in general, to the ordinary duty of becoming passionately involved with the daily problems of ordinary people relative to religion, poverty, and minorities – they wish to ignore, or, when forced to see, to punish. This version is consistent with her current claims to have been involved in late-60s liberal/left activism, but it doesn’t show her having been forced out of science by fear. Rather, she says “I realize my limitations.” But in a response to critics written in 2003 she says: “All I ever wanted to do was to get into a lab and cure cancer.” Rather than pining for Lee Oswald, her lost love, she is proud of her marriage and forthcoming child. But what is most striking is that the letter mentions nothing at all about the Kennedy assassination or Lee Oswald. Russell was a famous and outspoken assassination conspiracist , and the letter was written during the Garrison investigation in New Orleans. But her litany of the evils of American society has nary a mention of the assassination. Of course, according to Judyth, her life was interesting all they way back to childhood. Judyth told Prof. Luis Urrea that as a child she was a close friend of Dr. Seuss , and used the word “nerd” (which she had invented) in his presence. He liked it, and used it in one of his books, making it a common word in the language. Spying on LBJ Among the “interesting” things she claims to have done after the assassination was to “get inside” the Lyndon Johnson family to gain revealing information. At the time of Susie’s birth (Susan Mavinee – her middle name reflected “Lee” in rhyme) (she was named after Susie Hanover in New Orleans, my landlady who hid Lee so Robert didn’t catch him, several times) I penetrated so close to the LBJ household that my obstetrician was LBJ’s daughter’s obstetrician. I paid this high price myself (Robert would not have had a pricy O.B./GYN!) by painting him a hunting dog scene. His name: Dr. Robert Zschappel, and you can look it up. Now WHY do you think I would have ferreted out somebody close to the LBJ family, such as Zschappel, there in Austin, Texas? To get inside info on the LBJ family, the Robbs, etc. And I did, too, and sent it to the Village Voice , Space City News , and the Rag . [spelling, capitalization, and punctuation corrected, emphasis in original, emphasis added to periodical titles] Just what sinister information did Judyth get as a result of having the same obstetrician as LBJ’s daughter? When Martin Shackelford, a member of Team Judyth, was confronted with this question, he responded that “[s]he was awaiting a doctor’s appointment, and Luci and some of her friends walked in and struck up a conversation.” That claim sounds plausible enough, but how this allowed Judyth to get sinister inside information on the Johnson family is puzzling. The name “Mavinee” was the middle name of Robert Baker’s mother, not a name concocted to rhyme with “Lee.” Conclusion So just what are we to make of Judyth? Her story appears to be a elaborate tapestry woven around several kinds of elements. First, she has taken the artifacts of a fairly ordinary life and invested them with huge significance. A form letter from Bertrand Russell’s secretary becomes the remaining trace of a string of letters concerning sex and politics. A letter from Senator George Smathers congratulating her on her prowess as a science student is evidence that people in high places have noticed her and have slated her for covert use. A copy of Pushkin’s “Queen of Spades” becomes a book that she and Lee read together. Detailed Critique The Judyth Story has taken on a baroque complexity that boggles the mind. Dave Reitzes, perhaps the most assiduous of all the students of this issue, has complied a list of the twists and turns and contradictions in her account that have appeared over the last few years. It’s normal, of course, for any witness account to have a few inconsistencies around the edges. But what happens when a “witness” has been promiscuously weaving scores of conspiracy book factoids into her account, only to be confronted with their implausibility, or with the internal contradictions in the story she is telling? Another element is bits of the folklore surrounding the assassination. The fact that Greer slowed the presidential limo when the shooting started, or that Adlai Stevenson got rough treatment in Dallas a few weeks before Kennedy arrived, or that Oswald (supposedly) owned a Minox all get knitted into the narrative. So do most of the usual suspects of conspiracy writers. Finally, as David Lifton has pointed out, she has found the interstices in the biography of Oswald and inserted herself. For example, two of the witnesses to Oswald in Jackson, Louisiana (Edwin McGehee and Mary Morgan) described a woman in the car that Oswald drove. Since Marina denied that she made any such trip, this might seem to cast doubt on the notion that this was Oswald. But Judyth claims that she was the woman. Likewise, photos of Lee Oswald leafleting at the Trade Mart in New Orleans show some unidentified women at the scene. Judyth claims to have been one of them. The Credit Report The classic case of Judyth inserting herself in the historical record involves a “Character – Financial Report” on Lee Oswald that can be found in Warren Commission volume XXIV. It’s a rather odd document, attributing to the Oswald’s a net worth of $2,500, failing to mention Oswald’s defection to the Soviet Union, and saying that Oswald enjoys a “favorable business reputation.” Judyth claimed to have written the report as part of an operation to provide a “cover” for Lee concealing questionable aspects of his life. Unfortunately the FBI had, on the day following the assassination, interviewed the man who really wrote the report , one Henry Desmare of the Retail Credit Company. When Judyth and her supporters learned of the FBI interview, they began to claim that the Desmare interview was suspect, and that he (and perhaps the FBI agents who did the interview) were covering something up. In reality, investigators for the Retail Credit Company were badly overworked and had to resort to vague and innocuous boilerplate, guesses, and some outright fabrications. Judyth’s compulsion to explain even trivial details sometimes helps her, as researchers search the record and find that, yes, she is right about the detail she is “explaining.” But this compulsion gets her in trouble when she gets confused as to what her explanation is . Consider, for example, the fact that Lee Oswald, on his application for a tourist card to visit Mexico, listed his religion as “Catholic.” In fact, Lee was an atheist. Judyth had an explanation for this. In a newsgroup post in July, 1999, she claimed: . . . Lee was raised Lutheran, and at this time in his life, he didn’t believe in God, but on the application he put “Catholic” because to put “atheist” would have looked commie-suspicious. Because he knew both me and David Ferrie, and because his cousins were Catholic, Lee began using “Catholic” rather than “Lutheran” or “none.” Simple as that. Thanks for your response. Judyth [capitalization, punctuation and spelling errors corrected] But five years later, she told Black Op Radio that the reason was so that she and Lee could get “quickie divorces with a corrupt priest and go ahead and get married as Catholics.” But Judyth not only inserts herself into the suspicious parts of the existing historical record, she endows the mundane details of her life with spooky significance. For example, she worked at a burger joint called White Castle before going to work for the Reily Coffee Company. In a post on the JFK Research Forum on December 27, 2002, she talked about how the local NASA facility was a holding assignment for spooks, and then went on to explain that “. . . there were even people working at Meal-a-Minute and Royal Castle outlets between assignments, it depended on what the person was passing as in daily life.” In an e-mail sent November 16, 2000, she explained: I ended up getting a job at Royal Castle, not knowing it was (as Lee told me later) the drop where FBI and snitches dropped their information on Carlos Marcello, who was not far away at Town & Country. I have my check stub to prove I worked at Royal Castle out there. And finally, in a post on a British forum , she claimed that “That Royal Castle was the drop site for FBI and CIA surveillance of the Mafia Don.” In Judyth’s world, nothing is mundane, and everything has sinister significance. Motivation People who want to believe a problematic witness will often respond to criticisms with the query “why would she [or he] lie?” In the first place, the line between fantasy and reality can be much more slippery than most of us assume. Judyth, for example, has stated that: Dr. [Joseph] Reihl was the first one to gently suggest how to retrieve so many of my repressed memories, memories I had planned to take to the grave. The notion that a person has memories that are “repressed” and can be “recovered” is radically suspect in the eyes of modern social science. The “recovered” memories often turn out to be fantasies – which however come to be believed. Judyth can be heard recounting parts of her story on Black Op Radio . Here is the first part of her interview, and here is the second . Along similar lines, she has asserted “the writing of this book, including the reconstruction of the telephone calls I received . . . is based on principles I learned at the feet of Luis Urrea, 1999 American Book Award winner. . . .” She goes on to say, “[i]n Urrea’s ‘Creative Non fiction’ courses taught at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, I learned how to better recreate my memories into the most accurate reconstruction of the actual events. Urrea’s creative nonfiction works successfully bring to life his own extraordinary experiences, and include reconstructed dialogues. I have used Urrea’s methods in reconstructing the events between April and December of 1963 in that same manner.” Contrary to Judyth’s claims, Urrea insists he has “no magic formula” to aid anyone’s memory. “I just taught her in a writing workshop” he says. Judyth’s prose may have improved under Urrea’s tutelage, but it’s extremely unlikely her memory did. Judyth insists that her motivation is the vindicate her lover, Lee Harvey Oswald, whom she insists has been unfairly maligned as the killer of John Kennedy. She told Black Op Radio, for example that “someday there will be, like, a Lee Harvey Oswald action figure.” One might suspect that a witness is telling a particularly interesting story “for the money.” And indeed Judyth, as early as April 1999, had an agent named Peter Cox who was “shopping around” her book manuscript. One usually hires an agent when one wants to make some money. Indeed, it’s generally impossible to hire an agent if there is no money to be made. Someone who actually participated in a plot that killed two people – one of them the President of the United States – would probably be looking for a lawyer, or at least a journalist. In a biographical blurb to her high school classmates , she promised not only that a book titled Judyth and Lee would soon be out, but also said that “[w]e expect movie and television productions, etc.” Judyth has flatly claimed that the National Enquirer offered her $600,000 for her story. But when confronted on this by Louis T. Girdler, both she and Howard Platzman (a member of Team Judyth) admitted that there was no such offer, but rather that her agent thought that the account might be worth that much. But then in December, 2003, she was again claiming that she “refused to sell the story to The National Enquirer , that offered me a lot of money.” Indeed, when Judyth was first “shopping around” her manuscript to top New York publishers, she made it clear that she wanted a million dollars for the story. Reactions ranged from scorn to mild interest, but there were no takers at that price. But if simple venality was a large part of the story early on, her crusade to be believed took on a life of its own. While Team Judyth has worked on the “big score,” Judyth has been compulsively telling her story to anybody who would listen. She has made numerous posts on alt.assassination.jfk , and on the JFK Research message board . She has sent hundreds, if not thousands, of e-mails and spent many hours on the phone telling her story to anyone who expressed an interest. At one point, she was preparing to go to Dallas during the annual conspiracy convention (JFK Lancer’s “November in Dallas” ) and tell her story to anybody who would listen. Team Judyth dissuaded her. She has had little success in convincing researchers. Most of the people with whom she has shared her story have come away skeptical – some immediately, some after spending a great deal of time absorbing her story and believing it for a while. Five years after her agent began “shopping around” her story, there is still no book. CBS News’ “60 Minutes” considered her story at length, but decided they didn’t believe her. Nigel Turner , producer of “The Men Who Killed Kennedy”, taped an entire segment based on her story that aired in November, 2003. Few, even among the conspiracy-oriented viewers who post on assassination message boards, were convinced. As of this writing, she is in the Netherlands, proprietor of a small museum/art gallery that both sells her art and displays the artifacts that she claims connect her to Oswald. She continues to be very generous with her time with people interested in her story. She appears to be a woman who cares more about being believed than about making money. But it is more likely that she’ll make some money off the unending fascination with the JFK case than that people familiar with the historical record will believe her. And the Lee Harvey Oswald action figure isn’t in the cards. ● Acknowledgments – Thanks to the following people who have provided helpful information and critical comments on various drafts of this essay: Joe Biles, Robert Chapman, Dennis Frank, Louis Girdler, Paul Hoch, Robert Johnson, John Leyden, David Lifton, Dave Reitzes, and Paul Seaton.

Bogus JFK Assassination Conspiracy Evidence Bogus Evidence I t’s ironic, since conspiracy buffs are always claiming that the evidence against Oswald is all faked or forged. But in fact it is the conspiracy evidence in the case that is laced with faked documents, unreliable witnesses, and misrepresented facts. For example: a note (right) supposedly written by Oswald and addressed to a "Mr. Hunt" surfaced during the HSCA investigation. It supposedly ties Oswald to either CIA agent E. Howard Hunt or to Texas oilman H.L. Hunt. The HSCA gave the document to its panel of handwriting experts, and this is their very skeptical report . In 1999, the note was revealed to be a Soviet forgery in a book by KGB defector Vasili Mitrokhin . Here is the section of the book that describes the KGB’s involvement with Kennedy assassination disinformation. Citizens for Truth in the Kennedy Assassination (CTKA) in 1994 published a document (a police report), supposedly detailing an altercation between Jack Ruby and Lee Oswald at Mrs. Bledsoe’s boarding house. (Why were they fighting? Weren’t they coconspirators?). "A CTKA Story?" is researcher David Perry’s analysis of the document, showing it to be an obvious fake. Since Perry’s article was written, the hoaxers who wrote it have come forward and admitted the forgery . Yet CTKA, Jim Marrs, and Jack White all accepted the document as authentic. Blame Your Own Father for Killing Kennedy? That’s what Rickey White did. He claimed his father Roscoe White was tasked by shadowy Federal authorities to kill Kennedy as a "threat to national security." But the documents he had that supposedly proved this turned out to be forged. You can read about this sordid affair in the article "I Was Mandarin" which appeared in the Texas Monthly in December, 1990. Also see David Perry’s article " Who Speaks for Roscoe White? " first published in The Third Decade and now available in expanded form on Perry’s website . McCone-Rowley Document It has been around since circa 1990, but in the early 2000s a document, supposedly written by CIA chief John McCone to Secret Service chief James J. Rowley contained some explosive revelations about Lee Oswald being an agent in the service of U.S. security agencies. However, the document turned out to be a forgery , and even the vast majority of conspiracy theorists now reject it. Of course, most conspiracy theorists are honest, and would not forge documents to make their case. However, several have been fooled by these hoaxes, and it is ironic that all the proven forgeries connected with the case have come, not from the government, but from conspiracists. Mark Lane — Honest Advocate? No one has been more assiduous in promoting conspiracy theories than lawyer Mark Lane (right). And his lectures and books (especially Rush to Judgment and Plausible Denial ) have been extremely influential. But can you trust Mark Lane to tell you the truth and the whole truth about any subject he might be writing about? Check out some evidence. Lane told the Warren Commission that Tippit shooting witness Helen Markham said that the shooter was short, heavy, and with bushy hair. Here is a transcript of Lane’s telephone interview with Markham . Judge for yourself whether Markham was an easily manipulated witness, and whether Lane was an honest advocate. In his book Plausible Denial , Mark Lane presents himself as having convinced a jury, in a Federal court in Miami, that E. Howard Hunt was part of a JFK assassination conspiracy. If you believe Lane, it was a landmark case, vindicating what conspiracists have always claimed. But should you believe him? When author Jean Davison first became interested in the assassination, she read Lane’s account of Jack Ruby’s Warren Commission testimony, and then went on to examine what Ruby actually said. This short autobiographical account compares Lane’s version of what Ruby said with the unfiltered testimony. Julia Ann Mercer was a witness who claimed to have seen Jack Ruby and Lee Harvey Oswald together in Dealey Plaza shortly before the assassination. How Lane dealt with her testimony is the subject of this short essay . Want to see the primary sources on Mercer, and compare them to what Lane said? Click here . Journalist Hugh Aynesworth met Mark Lane in December of 1963 and supplied him with some then-secret witness statements. Seeing what Lane did with them , he was rather put off. If Lane cannot be trusted to fairly present the evidence about the assassination, how does he perform when he ventures into another area? In 1970 Lane published Conversations With Americans in which American soldiers described a number of atrocities committed by Americans in the Vietnam War. Anti-war journalist Neil Sheehan investigated the accounts in Lane’s book, and found most of them to be bogus . Although Mark Lane is on the political left, and blames the assassination on the CIA (which the left dislikes), that does not mean that everybody on the left (or even most leftists) have a favorable opinion of Lane. The magazine Mother Jones , for example, did an exposé of Lane, calling him "The Left's Leading Hearse-Chaser ." Misleading the House Select Committee Mark Lane has been a purveyor or Martin Luther King conspiracy theories too, and he represented King’s killer, James Earl Ray, before the House Select Committee on Assassinations. After investigating Lane’s claims, the Committee chastised him: Many of the allegations of conspiracy the committee investigated were first raised by Mark Lane, the attorney who represented James Earl Ray at the committee’s public hearings. As has been noted, the facts were often at variance with Lane’s assertions. . . . In many instances, the committee found that Lane was willing to advocate conspiracy theories publicly without having checked the factual basis for them. In other instances, Lane proclaimed conspiracy based on little more than inference and innuendo. Lane’s conduct resulted in public misperception about the assassination of Dr. King and must be condemned. (House Select Committee Report , Page 424, footnote 16) Firearms Factoids In real world criminal cases, scientific ballistic evidence is among the strongest evidence. In conspiracy books, this hard scientific evidence is cited to prove that Oswald could not have killed John Kennedy. Unfortunately, conspiracy authors have to cite a variety of pseudoscientific principles that real world forensics experts know to be nonsense. There are, for example: The failure of the Dallas cops to test the rifle found in the Depository to see whether it had been recently fired. The fact that Oswald’s fingerprints were not found on the rifle nor the pistol supposedly used to shoot Tippit. The negative paraffin test on Oswald cheek that supposedly shows he had not shot a rifle. The small throat wound which is supposedly too small to be an exit wound , and perhaps even an entry wound from a 6.5 mm. round. The ammunition clip that was claimed to have been missing when the rifle was recovered , and without which Oswald could not have fired three shots. Oswald supposedly unreliable ammunition , manufactured during the 1940s. The fact that Oswald’s rifle was described as "well-oiled," and therefore should have left traces of oil on the blanket in the Paine garage or on the paper bag that the Warren Commission said Oswald used to transport the rifle to the Depository. A much longer list of firearms factoids is a veritable cornucopia of bogus forensics principles. An All-Purpose Conspiracy Expert? L. Fletcher Prouty, a retired Air Force Colonel, was the model for Oliver Stone’s Mr. X. You can see Prouty in conspiracy documentaries posing as a expert on presidential protection, the origins of the Vietnam War, and journalism in New Zealand. Just who is this fellow? Does he actually know what he is talking about? Is he some kind of crackpot or something? Click here for the "scoop." Prouty has quite a lot of fans in conspiracy circles, and one of them has produced a web site devoted entirely to Prouty , his writing, and his opinions. Was Ruby Going to Expose The Conspiracy in Washington? Jack Ruby’s famous "I want to go to Washington" testimony before the Warren Commission . Did he really want to blow the whistle on The Conspiracy in D.C.? Tenuous "Connections" Conspiracy authors specialize in finding "connections" between supposedly "assassination related" people, and "connections" with government agencies. Just how spooky do these "connections" appear when closely scrutinized? Some of the employees at Oswald’s place of work in New Orleans, the Reily Coffee Company, left to take jobs at a nearby NASA facility . Lee and Maria Oswald, when they returned from the USSR to the Dallas/Fort Worth area, supposedly lost some of their luggage . A phone call is supposed to link David Ferrie to Jack Ruby . Does it? In the Marines, Lee Oswald got gonorrhea in a manner the Marines ruled "in the line of duty . . . not due to own misconduct." Does this imply that Oswald was, for example, sleeping with prostitutes on orders from some intelligence agency? Mark Zaid, a JFK assassination researcher and a lawyer, looked into this legal determination . Oswald, in custody of the Dallas police tried, according to several conspiracy books, to call a sinister fellow named John David Hurt in North Carolina. Hurt was supposedly connected with military intelligence, and so might have been Oswald's "contact." But is any of this actually true ? Should Oswald’s Interrogation Have Been Recorded? To anybody who watches TV crime dramas, it might seem obvious that Lee Harvey Oswald's interrogation should have been taped. Isn't that what the cops always do? Given the massive stakes in this case, isn't it suspicious that no audio recording was made? Unfortunately, what seems "obvious" today doesn't necessarily apply in 1963. As late as 2004, the Center on Wrongful Convictions was urging police departments to record interrogations . Indeed, their survey of police practices in that year showed that virtually no departments recorded suspect interrrogations as far back as 1963. As researcher Sandy McCroskey (who discovered this report) pointed out: All departments in Alaska record [interrogations] and had been doing so for nineteen years in 2004. That means they weren't in 1963, as they started only in 1985. Los Angeles had been recording for 23 years in 2004. That means they started only in 1981. What about New York City? Well, all we have for that state is Broome County, and it didn't start until 2002! Chicago? No department in Illinois started before 1994. Washington, DC started in 2003. No police department in Texas was recording interrogations until 1992. And of course, in 2004 a large number of departments still didn't record interrogations, a reality the Center on Wrongful Convictions was trying to reform. Goings On in Fort Worth "The Cowtown Connection" — an article by Duke Lane — examines the Fort Worth connection in the assassination and tests the veracity of a claim by Robert Morrow about the arrest of a "Maurice Bishop" in Fort Worth. Also: the Tom Tilson auto chase. Uploaded by permission. Invented Death Notice? Among the "Mystery Deaths" surrounding the assassination, one that has attracted particular interest is that of Karen Carlin. Interestingly, although she appears on the "Mystery Deaths" lists, there is no evidence that she is in fact dead! This essay, by researcher David Perry , deals with a claim that author Penn Jones, Jr. placed a fake death notice in one of his books at the request of a federal agent. Supposedly, Carlin was going into a witness protection program. See what Perry concludes about this claim. Changed Motorcade Route? I t’s supposed to indicate a conspiracy, and especially the involvement of Dallas City officials like Mayor Earle Cabell. The motorcade was, the story goes, originally supposed to go down Main Street in order to get on the Stemmons Freeway, rather than turn right on Houston, and then left on Elm. That’s what a map in the Nov. 22nd issue of the Dallas Morning News showed. But as is often the case, conspiracy books withhold important information from their readers. Click on the map at left/above to get the full story. This issue not only shows the unreliability of conspiracy books, it’s one about which Jim Garrison lied in On the Trail of the Assassins , and one that has trapped at least two suspect "witnesses" to sinister goings-on. Bobby Kennedy’s View of the Assassination You’ve probably seen the much cited claim that Robert Kennedy said that "only the powers of the Presidency" would get to the bottom of his brother’s death. One person who vividly remembers the speech in which RFK supposedly said this was author David Lifton. This is his own account from Compuserve , uploaded by permission. Clark Merrill tried to track this same claim about Bobby Kennedy in news reports from the 1968 Presidential Primary campaign. This article details what Bobby actually said. Compare it to what some conspiracy authors said he said. Did Nixon Think the Warren Commission Was a Hoax? Of course, what Robert Kennedy (above) or any other political figure thought about the assassination is irrelevant unless we assume that person had some sort of "inside information" that has never become part of the public record. Otherwise, their opinion is no better than anybody else’s, and less good than that of anybody who has studied the case. But that doesn’t stop conspiracists from quoting a BBC story that said that Nixon called the Warren Commission a "hoax." The quote is all over the Internet, but the people who are using it apparently have not bothered to check the primary source and see what Nixon actually said . A Thought From a Serious Conspiracy Researcher M y research has shown over 75% of all alleged facts in this case are false. Just take any book and compare the author’s conclusions to another author’s conclusions. Check each alleged fact in each book and see how many cancel or contradict each other. If all the alleged facts in all the conspiracy books were true, we could expect to have the following conclusions: The Grassy Knoll was a very busy place with many gunmen who never saw each other. There were at least 10 individuals depicted in the photos of the three tramps. There were at least 30 gunmen firing from 4 different buildings, the overpass, the Grassy Knoll, the South Knoll, the Presidential limo, the Secret Service follow-up car, the curb on Elm Street and the sewer. There were at least 100 conspirators in Dealey Plaza. These "facts" seem absurd and ridiculous but this is exactly what we end up with if we believe all of the conspiracy books which have been published. (Source: Bill Adams, "The Enemy Within") Do you think Adams is exaggerating? Check out David Perry’s "Rashomon to the Extreme" for a list off all the persons who have been "identified" as shooters or coconspirators in Dealey Plaza on the day of the assassination. Then check out Mike Griffith’s essay "Extra Bullets and Missed Shots in Dealey Plaza" for more of the kind of "evidence" that Adams is talking about. Winnowing the Wheat and the Chaff In an area so awash in bogus, fabricated, and unreliable information, how does one sort through the evidence? Veteran researcher Paul Hoch provides some guidance in a talk he gave at the Second Annual Midwest Symposium on Assassination Politics in Chicago in 1993. People With "Foreknowledge" of the Assassination? Richard Case Nagell claimed to have been working for the KGB and the CIA, and to have been tasked with breaking up an assassination plot against Kennedy that both agencies knew about, and which involved Lee Oswald. Dave Reitzes discusses his frequently changing, often contradictory stories in "Truth or Dare: The Lives and Lies of Richard Case Nagell." Joseph Milteer supposedly had "foreknowledge" of the assassination. A far-right extremist, he made several statements to an FBI informant — two weeks before the assassination — about how Kennedy was going to be killed. Did he actually know something about an impending assassination? Or was he merely a blowhard? Click here to see how conspiracy books conceal certain of his statements . Just how much does he seem to know when you look at more of what he said? Rose Cherami (often wrongly spelled "Cheramie") is another of the people with supposed "foreknowledge" of the assassination. Her story is in all the assassination books, but British author Chris Mills has collected new primary sources. His Rambling Rose is an essay that takes us beyond the usual treatment. Mills believes she may have had actual foreknowledge of the assassination (although I think he’s wrong about that). More recent research into Cherami’s death by Dave Reitzes shows that the claims of "foreknowledge" are apparently bogus, and that the very earliest sources show no such thing. Reitzes has a very comprehensive collection of primary source documents on this woman. Cherami: A Mysterious Death? Conspiracy books, following Gary Shaw, often claim that Cherami's death was a murder, presumably committed by people who wanted to shut her up. Unfortunately, the evidence shows otherwise . Let’s Just Think for a Minute About "Foreknowledge" The House Select Committee on Assassinations examined Secret Service files, and found that from March through December 1963 the agency received information on over 400 possible threats to the President. (See the HSCA Report , p. 230.) Of course, many instances of loose and violent talk about the President being killed never were reported. For example, the rantings of Joseph Milteer (see above) attracted Secret Service attention, but the statements of Rose Cherami did not. Each of these threats could be interpreted as "foreknowledge" of the assassination. Somebody talked about the president going to be killed, and the president was killed. Foreknowledge. Bogus "Confessions" We might expect that anybody who took part in the assassination would keep quiet about it. But interestingly, several people have some forward to "confess" a role. Judyth Baker claims to have been Lee Oswald’s girlfriend in New Orleans in the summer of 1963, and to have participated with him in a top secret bioweapons program to kill Castro. The story is perhaps the most elaborate and multifaceted to come from any "conspiracy witness," but is it true? James Files, whose story is promoted in a video produced by one Bob Vernon, claims to have been the Grassy Knoll shooter. There are serious questions about his credibility, however . Another person who has recently "confessed" a connection with the assassination is one Tex Brown, who claims to have taught Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby how to shoot a rifle. In his review of the book Broken Silence , researcher David Perry evaluates this tale. One Robert Morrow has claimed a role in the shooting as a supplier of rifles and of electronic devices. Ulric Shannon, in this thorough review of Morrow’s book First Hand Knowledge , questions whether Morrow’s "knowledge" was really first-hand, as opposed to picked up from various conspiracy books. It might seem odd that the Dallas police would put Oswald into a cell with any other suspect, but one John Elrod has claimed that he was Oswald’s cellmate , and that Oswald "spilled the beans" about a connection with Jack Ruby and a role in a gun running plot. "What About All Those Strange and Convenient Deaths?" It’s one of the staples of the conspiracy literature — the idea that a very large number of people "connected with the assassination" have died under "mysterious" circumstances. Supposedly, a conspiracy "cleanup squad" is running around killing people. See what the actual facts look like . Washington, DC Phone Outage I t sure sounds like something sinister: the fact that the phone system in Washington, DC, went down in the minutes following the shooting of Kennedy. Was this evidence of a coup d’etat in progress, or the normal results of thousands of people seeking to tell friends and neighbors the news? As is usual with conspiracy books claims, the more you know the less sinister it seems . Mangling What the Warren Commission Said In an attempt to determine whether it would have been possible for Oswald to have shot Kennedy in the time he had available, the Warren Commission requested a number of shooting trials from government agencies. What did the trials show? How do conspiracy books present the trials? Click here to find out. Gaeton Fonzi: A Story Too Good to Be True O ne of the more colorful claims in Gaeton Fonzi’s The Last Investigation concerns Miami-based reporter Hal Hendrix. Fonzi wants to label Hendrix a spook, and provides some interesting "evidence" of this. The Fonzi Version The next year Hendrix got himself promoted to a more prestigious job, covering Latin America for the Script-Howard News Service. Still based in Miami, Hendrix’ sources remained quite extraordinary. In a piece for Scripps-Howard dated September 23rd, 1963, Hendrix wrote a colorful and detailed description of the coup that toppled Juan Bosch, the leftist president of the Dominican Republic. If Hendrix’ report didn’t come from inside sources, it was an amazing display of clairvoyance — the coup didn’t take place until the following day. The Last Investigation , p. 325. The Reality In the days before the coup, Hendrix wrote a three-part series, with each article in the series dealing with a different nation. First there was Cuba, then the Dominican Republic, and then Haiti. My student Mark Rausch managed to locate three Scripts-Howard papers that ran Hendrix’s series: the Albuquerque Tribune , the Rocky Mountain News , and the El Paso Herald Post . All ran Hendrix’ story on the Dominican Republic one or two days before the coup. So what did Hendrix’ story say? Here is the lead paragraph: The newly won democracy in the Dominican Republic is in danger of disintegrating. The government of President Juan Bosch, inaugrated only eight months ago, may not survive the year. That’s a prediction that the government will fall, but it’s miles from a "colorful description" of a coup. Hendrix goes on to explain the problems facing the nation, mentioning: A preoccupation "among Western diplomats and responsible Dominicans" with increasing Communist activity. Incompetence that has "riddled the Bosch administration." Bosch’s own stubbornness, vanity, and "lack of administrative talent." The fact that "nearly every Dominican male" carries a concealed weapon. Dimming economic prospects. Foreign investors wary of political instability. Where in this article did Fonzi see a "colorful and detailed description of the coup?" The assumption must be that Fonzi was simply passing along hearsay, and never bothered to check out this particular story. Another "Official Story" Conspiracy buffs are ever suspicious of the "official story" and "government propaganda." In at least one case, however, many have been crudulous toward a piece of propaganda from a very different source. Farewell America is a book whose origins are explored in this essay by John Locke. Further analyses of this book, as well as the complete text , can be found on Dave Reitzes’ web site. One bogus factoid about Farewell America was that it was "banned in the U.S." But accounts by the two people most involved with the book in the United States, Warren Hinckle and William Turner , make it clear this is not so. Those Conspiracy "Photo Experts" They will assure you that all the evidence implicating Oswald is faked. They will assure you they see evidence of a conspiracy in films, still photos, movie footage, and x-rays. Do the conspiracy "photographic experts" know what they are talking about? Let’s take a look: Tom Wilson — Found a bullet entrance in the front of Kennedy’s suit jacket . Groden and Livingstone — An autopsy photo that shows the back of Kennedy’s head blown out . Robert Groden — photo of O.J. Simpson was faked . Robert Groden — a "second rifle" brought down from the Depository . Robert Groden — a figure in the background of newsreel footage of Oswald is Clay Shaw . Jack White — Inconsistent dimensions of rifle in backyard photos . House Select Committee on Assassinations — How real photo experts work . A Photo of Two Men in the Sniper's Nest? Since the Warren Commission believed that Oswald alone shot Kennedy from the sixth floor window of the Texas School Book Depository, a photo of two men in that window at the time of the shooting would be virtually incontestable proof of a conspiracy. A photogapher named Norman Similas claimed to have taken just such a photo. Unfortunately, he could never produce it, and his credibility was highly questionable . Was the Chain of Evidence Broken? Conspiracy authors are always claiming that the physical evidence against Lee Oswald would have been "inadmissible" in court because the "chain of evidence" was broken. Unfortunately, the same conspiracist authors who invent forensics principles unknown to the law enforcement community also seem to invent rules of criminal procedure unknown to the courts. An authoritative summary in a standard textbook on police procedure shows that essentially all the evidence against Oswald would have been admissible. Dallas Police Evidence Tampering? The evidence against Oswald was so massive, and so apparently damning, that conspiracists pretty much have to insist that much of it was faked, forged, or altered. And indeed, they have produced "evidence" of Dallas police tampering. One piece of evidence discovered by the police was a photo that shows the back yard of General Walker (whom Oswald tried to kill ), and the version that now exists has the license plate of a car parked behind Walkers house torn out. Supposedly, photographic evidence shows that the plate was intact when the Dallas cops recovered the photo. But a closer look at the evidence shows the conspiracy books jumping to conclusions. The Dallas police claimed to have found three spend cartridges in the Sniper’s Nest, corresponding perfectly to the three shots that the vast majority of Dealey Plaza witnesses heard. But author Noel Twyman found what he thought was evidence that only two spent rounds were recovered . Photos of Dealey Plaza in the minutes following the assassination supposedly show a Dallas Police officer, a Sheriff’s Deputy, and a mysterious government agent finding and picking up a slug. Was this an example of authorities suppressing evidence ? A Crank Phone Call is Evidence? K aren Carlin (stage name: "Little Lynn") was one of Jack Ruby’s stip-tease dancers. She phoned Ruby on the morning of November 24th, 1963, and asked him to wire her $25 that she needed for rent and groceries. Had she not phoned, Ruby would not have been in downtown Dallas that Sunday morning and almost certainly would not have shot Oswald. After the assassination, Carlin turned up on the lists of "mysterious deaths" — although in fact there was no evidence she was dead. Author John Davis takes the story from there: . . . in October 1992, Karen Carlin came back from the dead. She contacted Gary Shaw, director of the JFK Assassination Information Center in Dallas, after almost thirty years living under an assumed identity, and told him she knew of a conspiracy to kill Lee Harvey Oswald, that Ruby told her to phone him Sunday morning and that an hour later he would telegraph her $25, just before shooting Oswald, to establish an alibi to justify his shooting of Oswald as an impulsive act of revenge. And who was ultimately behind the conspiracy to kill Oswald? Karin [sic] Carlin mentioned two names to Gary Shaw, Carlos Marcello and Santos Trafficante, Jr. (John Davis, The Kennedy Contract , p. 107.) Needless to say, "Carlin" has not come forward to confirm her identity, testify or answer questions, or otherwise make herself available. The whole affair is just one phone call to Shaw — who has been involved in a variety of other dubious "revelations" in the case . Return to Kennedy Assassination Home Page

Kennedy Assassination "Mystery Deaths" Jim Marrs' List Really So Mysterious? "Strange" and "Convenient" Deaths Surrounding the Assassination I f there really was the vast conspiracy that the buffs claim, then a lot of people have to know about it. Indeed, a lot of people have to have been part of it — not to speak of the people who must have been intimidated, bribed, or otherwise forced to cooperate by giving false testimony, covering up key evidence, or keeping quiet about some sinister thing they knew. So why have no credible witnesses come forward with the evidence necessary to blow open the coverup? For the hard-core conspiracy believers, it's because a "clean-up squad" is going around the country killing off people who might "blow the whistle!" This theme was first taken up by Penn Jones, Jr., publisher of the Midlothian Mirror , a small-town Texas paper. The most widely cited current list of "mystery deaths" was published by author Jim Marrs (who also released the book Alien Agenda about UFOs). His book Crossfire contains a list of 103 people who have supposedly died "strange" or "convenient" or "mysterious" deaths. As Marrs puts it: This section has been entitled "Convenient Deaths" because these deaths certainly would have been convenient for anyone not wishing the truth of the JFK assassination to become public. Unfortunately for Marrs and other conspiracy authors, the logical problems with this whole argument are many and massive. If the purpose of the "clean-up squad" is to eliminate people who have knowledge of a conspiracy, recruiting people into a "clean-up squad" is a counter-productive activity. Each person recruited becomes yet another person who has knowledge of a conspiracy and might "spill the beans." Marrs' list is drawn from a pool of literally thousands of people — a few of whom had a clear connection with the assassination, many of whom had some tangential connection with the assassination, and some of whom had no connection with the assassination at all. For example, Marrs' list includes one woman who was one of Kennedy's mistresses, but had no known connection with the assassination. It includes a man who was mayor of New Orleans (but who had no known connection with the assassination), and it includes the Chief Steward on Air Force One! The list includes people who were merely connected to the Mafia, the CIA, anti-Castro Cubans, or Time-Life, Incorporated. Marrs is assuming that all these groups were connected with the assassination. In other words, he assumes a conspiracy involving all these groups, tabulates deaths, and then announces that the large number of deaths supports the idea of a conspiracy! Circular logic. Most well-known conspiracy witnesses and authors are still alive. For example, of the best-known conspiracy authors who wrote books in the 1960s, Edward J. Epstein and Josiah Thompson are still alive. Mark Lane died in 2016. Sylvia Meagher is dead, but not even Marrs lists her death as "suspicious." Penn Jones died in January 1998 in a nursing home at the age of 83 after a long struggle with Alzheimer's disease. Harold Weisberg likewise died in February of 2002 after a long period of failing health. The most prominent conspiracy authors from the 70s and early 80s like David Lifton, Robert Groden, Henry Hurt, and Anthony Summers are all still alive. The star conspiracy witnesses who are seen in all the videos had long lives. Beverly Oliver is still alive. Malcolm Summers died on October 8, 2004 , Ed Hoffman passed away in 2010. Jean Hill passed away on November 7, 2000 . All three witnesses died after having decades to give their testimony to anybody who would listen, and not even their conspiracist supporters claim their deaths were sinister. If a conspiracy was going around killing people who knew things that were dangerous to it, it would make sense that all the key witnesses would be killed quickly. But Marrs' list includes people who died as late as 1984. Given that many people associated with the assassination were at the peak of their professional careers at the time of the shooting, it's not surprising that many of them would have died within twenty years. Marrs' list is laced with people who have a larger than average chance of a violent death: law officers, people on the edges of the underworld (strippers), people very much part of the underworld (Mafia figures), and people with a clear history of alcohol or drug abuse, or of mental illness (Rose Cheramie, Lou Staples, George de Mohrenschildt). About half the people on Marrs' list died of natural causes. Marrs assures his readers that of course the CIA can kill people and make the death look "natural" ( Crossfire , p. 556-557). This raises the question of why the conspirators allowed any of the deaths to seem violent or suspicious. It was also terribly convenient for supposed conspirators that so many of the people on the list who are claimed to have died of heart attacks (see below) had arteriosclerotic heart disease, making their deaths plausibly natural. In virtually every case, there is no evidence that the person had any information on the assassination not already given in Warren Commission testimony, statements to police and the media, and interviews with private researchers. The logic seems to be that they must have known something, since, after all, they were killed. People who supported the Warren Commission version of events, or whose testimony was used by the Warren Commission to help convict Oswald, are well-represented on the list. Why would a conspiracy want to kill off those people? Many of these objections can be answered by positing on ongoing surveillance of witnesses. Maybe a witness, after many years of concealing the truth, has finally decided to go public and "blow the whistle." Conspirators, learning of this, then proceed to kill the person. What's wrong with this is obvious: it vastly complicates the problem discussed in 1. (above). For every witness who might potentially "spill the beans," a team of conspiracy operatives must keep a close surveillance in order to catch the moment when the person decides to talk, and then promptly kill the witness. This would require an entire army of assassins! M arrs tries to argue for the sinister nature of his list by saying: Of course, it is impossible to state with any certainty which of these deaths resulted from natural causes and which did not. . . . The area of convenient deaths leads one into a well of paranoia, yet the long list of deaths cannot be summarily dismissed. Given the immensely large pool from which the hundred or so people on Marrs' list are drawn, one of two things must be true. Either: (1) many hundreds or thousands of deaths have escaped Marrs' notice, or (2) being associated with the Kennedy assassination is a guarantee of a very long life! Begging the Question Conspiracists put on their list people associated with some group that they suspect was involved with the assassination. Thus any Mafia figure who died is put on the list (regardless of any evidence of involvement) since after all, the Mafia is suspect. It's the same with CIA people (again, regardless of the lack of any evidence of involvement) since the CIA is suspect. The same goes for FBI employees, anti-Castro Cubans, anybody with any connection to Jack Ruby, and so on. Even staffers for LIFE Magazine are included, since they were supposedly engaged in a cover-up. Of course, if all these groups were involved, that would imply a implausably massive conspiracy. But if only one of the groups, or some small faction of some of the groups was involved, then most of the names don't belong on the list. Let's Look at Specifics The death of Lee Bowers seemed "strange" to Oliver Stone, Geraldo Rivera, and Jim Marrs. David Perry is an insurance investigator by profession, and an assassination buff by avocation. See what he concluded when he investigated this issue. Another "mysterious" death was that of David Ferrie. Did he commit suicide to avoid being prosecuted for Kennedy's murder by DA Garrison? Was he killed by minions of The Conspiracy? In this essay, Dr. Robert Artwohl discusses Jim Garrison's contention that Ferrie died of an overdose of Proloid , a thyroid medication, and Garrison's apparent mishandling of evidence. Ferrie left two supposed "suicide notes," however on close inspection it's not at all clear they are in fact suicide notes. The official autopsy produced a clear finding of natural death. Eladio del Valle, a Cuban who died on the same night as David Ferrie, is another of those "mystery deaths." Conspiracy books imply that he had all sorts of "links" to the assassination, but there are some other things about him that make his death seem not so mysterious. Click here for documents on del Valle. Conspiracy books never tell you, but the Dade County authorities indicted a man for del Valle's murder. More information can be found on Gordon Winslow's web site. Dorothy Kilgallen, a reporter and quiz show personality, is always among those on the "mysterious deaths" lists. Supposedly, she was about to "blow the lid" off the conspiracy. In this essay , historian Eric Paddon does not discuss the circumstances of her death ( which the medical examiner didn't consider sinister ), but rather the question of whether she actually knew anything that might threaten a supposed conspiracy. Had she learned something new about the assassination, or was she just repeating standard conspiracy buff stuff? How might Kilgallen have gotten critical information that would have allowed her to "blow" the conspiracy? According to Gary Wills and Ovid Demaris, ( Jack Ruby , page 72): Conspiratorialists of the wilder variety believe that Dorothy Kilgallen had a private interview [with Jack Ruby], one that caused her death. This tete-a-tete never took place: she leaned over the rail and talked to Jack in the open courtroom during a break in the proceedings. Lawyer Joe Tonahill, who hoped to collaborate with Miss Kilgallen on a book, arranged the brief exchange, and was present at it. But the important thing, as John Leyden has pointed out, is that Kilgallen didn't die "mysteriously" until 20 months after the interview. Darn patient reporter who can sit on a big story that long. Colonel Daniel Marvin told an explosive story in the most recent installment of The Men Who Killed Kennedy . He claimed to have been asked by a CIA operative to kill a supposed autopsy witness named William B. Pitzer. If true, it's hard evidence of a conspiracy "clean-up squad" killing witnesses. Researchers Robin Palmer and Allan Eaglesham have worked closely with Marvin, and have come to doubt his story. Their "Letter to Dr. J.D. Rose" lays out the details. Eaglesham, who initially believed the death was "suspicious," has now concluded that it wasn't. A diligent and honest researcher, he continued investigating even after reaching that conclusion, and that research solidified his view that the death was indeed a suicide. Umpteen Trillion to One Odds? The conspiracy literature occasionally still quotes a supposed study done by the London Sunday Times which found that "the odds against these [assassination] witnesses being dead by February 1967, were one hundred thousand trillion to one." The House Select Committee on Assassinations asked the newspaper where they got that number. The paper replied with the following letter. The Editor has passed me your letter of 25th April. Our piece about the odds against the deaths of the Kennedy witnesses was, I regret to say, based on a careless journalistic mistake and should not have been published. This was realized by The Sunday Times' editorial staff after the first edition — the one which goes to the United States and which I believe you have — had gone out, and later editions were amended. There was no question of our actuary having got his answer wrong. It was simply that we asked him the wrong question. He was asked what were the odds against 15 named people out of the population of the United States dying within a short period of time to which he replied — correctly — that they were very high. However, if one asks what are the odds against 15 of those included in the Warren Commission index dying within a given period, the answer is, of course, that they are much lower. Our mistake was to treat the reply to the former question as if it dealt with the latter — hence the fundamental error in our first edition report, for which we apologize. None of the editorial staff involved in this story can remember the name of the actuary we consulted, but in view of what happened you will, I imagine, agree that his identity is hardly material. Yours sincerely, Antony Whitaker, Legal Manager. (4 HSCA 464-65) George deMohrenschildt was one of Lee Oswald's most interesting friends. His testimony before the Warren Commission said nothing that suggested a conspiracy, but in later years he started to give a much more "interesting" account. DeMohrenschildt's suicide in 1977 has seemed quite "suspicious" to conspiracy buffs. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office Death Investigation on deMohrenschildt's passing is extremely detailed. See whether there is any evidence of murder. John M. Crawford is yet another of those people on the "mystery deaths" lists. Did he really have the "connections" to Wes Frazier and Jack Ruby that conspiracy authors claim? See David Perry's assessment of this case . What happens when a real investigator (Jacqueline Hess of the House Select Committee) tackles the issue of "mysterious deaths" and enlists the services of people who specialize in working out the probability that any particular person will die in a year, or two, or ten? In other words, enlists the service of actuaries? Hess' testimony before the House Select Committee outlines the results of her investigation. Marrs List of "Mystery Deaths" Note: information in the first four columns is from Marrs, the "Comment" is by the author of this web page. Chris Simondet, in a fine research effort, turned up the death certificates of many of the people on the list. It's interesting, isn't it, that deaths that seem "mysterious" when you know none of the details look rather ordinary when you know more. * = Marrs considers death "particularly suspicious" Date Name Marrs: Connection with case Marrs: Cause of death Comment 11/63 Karyn Kupcinet TV host's daughter who was overheard telling of JFK's death prior to 11/22/63 Murdered No corroboration for Penn Jones' implausible "foreknowledge" claim. 12/63 Jack Zangretti Expressed foreknowledge of Ruby shooting Oswald Gunshot Victim Actually "Zangetty." Unsourced claim by Penn Jones with no corroboration. Supposedly, member of Sinatra family was to be kidnapped. 2/64 Eddy Benavides Lookalike brother to Tippit shooting witness, Domingo Benavides Gunshot to head Innocent bystander killed in bar brawl .

When the House Select Committee on Assassinations wished to study the "mysterious deaths" associated with the assassination, they asked the Congressional Research Service — a division of the Library of Congress — to investigate a list of such deaths from published sources. The resulting CRS report is merely preliminary, but it shows the appalling number of factual errors in the conspiracy books pushing the notion, and the utterly non-mysterious nature of most of the deaths. Click on the name below to see the relevant section of the CRS report. Introduction to Report Edward/Eddie Benavides Albert Guy Bogard Hale Boggs Lee Bowers, Jr. Bill Chesher Nicholas J. Chetta, M.D. David Goldstein Thomas Hale (Tom) Howard William (Bill) Hunter Clyde Johnson Dorothy Kilgallen Thomas Henry (Hank) Killam Jim Koethe Levens (first name unknown) Nancy Jane Mooney (also known as Betty McDonald) Teresa Norton Earlene Roberts Harold Russell Marilyn April Walle, a.k.a. Marilyn Moon, Marilyn Magyar, Delilah William W. Whaley James R. Worrell Believing it All W hat happens when you believe essentially all the claims about mysterious deaths, not only in Marrs' book but on the Internet? You come up with a morass of mutually contradictory theories. Thus Richard Belzer's book Hit List parades before the reader an incoherent collection of conspiracy speculations that implicates almost everybody, as Marilyn Elias explains in her review of the book . Further detracting from the credibility of the volume is Belzer's association with crackpot conspiracy talk show host Alex Jones, and his proclamation that the U.S. is a "fascist state" run by "sociopaths" — both assertions on Belzer's part that Elias documents. Roger Craig Roger Craig told a variety of "interesting" stories about the assassination, most of which clearly indicated a conspiracy. So it might seem quite logical that a conspiracy would want to silence him. And indeed Craig's death at age 39 in 1975 by suicide (conspiracy books usually put quotes around "suicide") might seem suspicious. But do the details of his death actually seem suspicious? Rose Cherami Rose Cherami (whose many aliases included "Melba Marcades" and "Melba Youngblood") was a drug addict and prostitute whom conspiracists believe had "foreknowledge" of the assassination. If she did, it might be expected that conspirators might kill her to silence her, and indeed she was run over by a car and mortally injured on a rural road in Texas. Conspiracy theorist J. Gary Shaw claims that hospital records show she had a "deep punctate stellate wound above her right forehead," suggesting she was shot. But unfortunately, neither Shaw nor anybody else has produced such records. Her death certificate records no such wound, and says her injuries were the result of being "struck by an auto." A newspaper account of her death mentions nothing suggesting a murder. (Thanks to Tom Scully for finding these documents.) Let's Just Think About This, OK? Excerpted from "The Case of the Grassy Knoll: The Romance of Conspiracy" by John Kaplan; printed in The Historian As Detective , Winks, editor; originally published as "The Assassins" in Stanford Law Review (May 1967). [Regarding the "mysterious" deaths of "witnesses" to the assassination], even the most cursory examination of the stories shows how essentially foolish they are. A good many of the deaths hardly seem mysterious in that they were caused by auto accidents, heart attacks, and other phenomena that afflict our entire population. Moreover, before we could tell whether the number of these deaths is in any way unusual, we would have to know the number of equally "mysterious" deaths that occurred to people completely unconnected with the WR. But even apart from any statistical refutation, the theory that a set of conspirators is now devoted to wiping out a host of unimportant witnesses is almost too silly to be put forth. There is not the slightest indication that any of the "victims" have had anything to tell that they had not already told, and indeed the deaths seem concentrated among those who bore only the most peripheral relation to the assassination. When one stops to consider that almost each one of the "mysterious" deaths requires the recruitment of at least one and often several new conspirators, it would seem that, like the pyramid club, the conspiracy would be getting bigger and bigger rather than smaller. One would think that in light of what had happened to those who knew too much it would get very difficult to recruit new members into the conspiracy. Most important, however, it is hard to say why the supposed killers are taking whatever chances these murders entail when it is so obvious that, whoever the conspirators are, they have already gotten off scot-free.

Roger Craig -- The Rambler Man Roger Craig The Rambler Man D allas County Sheriff's Deputy Roger Craig had quite a lot of interesting stories to tell. And in good storyteller fashion, his stories got better over time. Craig was one of the conspiracy witnesses that the Warren Commission called to testify. He was given featured treatment in early conspiracy works such as Mark Lane's Rush to Judgment . More recently, his testimony is treated as credible in most conspiracy books. You can see him in the video "Two Men in Dallas." The essay, "The Rambler Man" is David Perry's investigation into the Craig story. It's excellent — indeed indispensible — background reading. The table below summarizes key elements of Craig's testimony, and what the evidence is on each. The Testimony of Roger Craig Statement Was he saying this in 1963-64? Evaluation Was standing on Main Street near Dealey Plaza at time of shooting — heard three shots Yes Entirely plausible. Saw officer running up Grassy Knoll Yes Supported by photographic evidence Talked to Arnold Rowland who saw second man on 6th floor of Depository Yes Almost certainly true. Consistent with Rowland's testimony to Warren Commission. Saw .45 slug in Dealey Plaza — with piece of Kennedy's head No Absolutely zero supporting evidence. Claim contradicts his own Warren Commission testimony , and the testimony of everyone else in the area. . Heard shrill whistle, saw Oswald run from direction of Depository and get into Rambler station wagon on Elm Street with dark complected man Yes Implies absurd escape scenario — both reliable testimony and a transfer found in Oswald's pocket show him to have been on a bus at this time. Saw three hulls in Sniper's Nest — lined up an inch apart, all pointing in the same direction. Click here for illustration from video "Two Men in Dallas" No Flatly contradicted by officers who discovered Sniper's Nest. Hulls were photographed in place, and Deputy Luke Mooney marked photograph showing their locations. Was with Luke Mooney when he and Mooney both discovered the spent cartridges. No Flatly contradicts Craig's own Warren Commission testimony . Looked at his watch upon hearing of the Tippit shooting, and saw the time was 1:06 p.m., too early for the shooter to have been Oswald No Contradicted by other evidence, and by Craig's own 1968 interview. Saw inscription "7.65 Mauser" on recovered rifle No Contradicted by testimony of all officers present — newsfilm at scene shot by Tom Alyea shows rifle to be Mannlicher-Carcano. Here is one frame from his 16 mm. film , and here is another . In 1968, Craig gave a contradictory account. Confronted Oswald in Fritz' office — Oswald said Rambler was Mrs. Paine's station wagon Yes Contradicted by officers present in Fritz' office. Dallas Police and FBI documents show that Mrs. Paine's station wagon was a Chevrolet. There were attempts on his life No No supporting evidence has been produced. If attempts described were real, they were extremely lame. The Station Wagon that Changed Color The following is from David Perry's essay, "The Rambler Man." It was one thing for Mrs. Paine to own a station wagon with a luggage rack but was the vehicle a Nash Rambler? Was it green? Why did Buddy Walthers bring the subject up? Why was Craig not positive but only believed someone went by the house? Who was the "they" that went to the Paine home to check on the car? Craig's autobiographical declaration that "Mrs. Ruth Paine, the woman Marina Oswald lived with in Irving, Texas, owned a Rambler station wagon, at that time, of this same color." was on the verge of collapse. What is more important, Fritz challenged not only Craig's story but his credibility as well. . . . What about the color of the station wagon? Craig made it a point to claim his testimony was changed with respect to the color of the car. "I said the Rambler station wagon was light green. The Warren Commission: Changed [it] to a white station wagon . . ." Curious, I went back to Craig's deposition of November 25, 1963. I concluded the Warren Commission could alter the testimony but would have to go to extreme lengths to change a document obtained three days after the assassination. FBI Special Agent Benjamin O. Keutzer took Craig's statement. It appears in Commission Exhibit No. 1993, [CE 1993]. "He stated he also noticed an automobile traveling west on Elm, which he feels was a white Nash Rambler station wagon with a luggage rack on top." This seemed to confirm that Craig originally thought the car was white. I still couldn't understand why color was so important. Why was it necessary for the station wagon to be green rather than white? A little more research resolved the issue. In Warren Commission Volume II, pg. 506, [2H506] the following exchange takes place. Mr. Jenner: "Describe your automobile, will you please?" Mrs. Paine: "It is a 1955 Chevrolet station wagon, green, needing paint, which we bought secondhand. It is in my name." I thought I was seeing things! Ruth Paine owned a green Chevrolet not a Nash Rambler? . . . One can almost picture Roger Craig, trying to stir the assassination conspiracy pot. Failing to verify facts, depending upon memories inactive for four years, assuming "they" whoever "they" were checked the automobile at the Paine house, relying on Buddy Walthers spotty remarks, accusing the Warren Commission of altering testimony so the color of the vehicles matched . . . . To what purpose? To implicate Ruth Paine in the plot? If not, why the great charade? The Bullet Not Seen The following is from the Warren Commission testimony of Craig: Mr. CRAIG. Well, I looked around for a little bit, you know, just observing the people and things. . . . And then it was either Lemmy Lewis or Buddy Walthers-(spelling) W-a-l-t-h-e-r-s, one of our other criminal investigators, said that one of the bullets had ricocheted off the south curb of Elm Street. So, Officer Lewis and I crossed-walked down the hill and crossed Elm Street to look for the place where the bullet might have hit. Mr. BELIN. Did he say why he believed one of the bullets ricocheted off the south curb of Elm? Mr. CRAIG. No; he just said that someone said that one of them had. So we checked it. Mr. BELIN. So, you searched the south curb of Elm? Mr. CRAIG. Right. Mr. BELIN. Did you find anything there to indicate the ricocheted bullet? Mr. CRAIG. No; we didn't find anything at that time. (6H265) So Craig originally said he saw no bullet near the south curb of Elm Street. But by the 1970s (when he recorded the interview found in "Two Men in Dallas") he was giving a vivid description of the discovery of the supposed .45 slug. The "Mauser" Early reports said the rifle recovered on the 6th floor of the Depository was a Mauser, but this was quickly corrected when the Dallas police had sufficient time to examine the rifle. Craig's early account, as given to the Los Angeles Free Press (March 1968) , provides an interesting variation on the "Mauser" story. In the following, "FP" is "Free Press," "RC" is "Roger Craig," and "PJ" is conspiracist newspaperman "Penn Jones." FP: Did you handle that rifle? RC: Yes, I did. I couldn't give its name because I don't know foreign rifles, I know it was foreign made, and you loaded it downward into a built-in clip. The ID man took it and ejected one live round from it. The scope was facing north, the bolt facing upwards and the trigger south. But there was another rifle, a Mauser, found up on the roof of the depository that afternoon. FP: A Mauser on the roof? Who found it? PJ: I don't know who found it, but I do know that a police officer verified its existence. In later years, however, Craig's account changed and he adopted the orthodox conspiracy version that has the Mauser found on the 6th floor. In his memoir When They Kill a President Craig claims: Lt. Day inspected the rifle briefly, then handed it to Capt. Fritz who had a puzzled look on his face. Seymour Weitzman, a deputy constable, was standing beside me at the time. Weitzman was an expert on weapons. He had been in the sporting goods business for many years and was familiar with all domestic and foreign weapons. Capt. Fritz asked if anyone knew what kind of rifle it was. Weitzman asked to see it. After a close examination (much longer than Fritz or Day's examination) Weitzman declared that it was a 7.65 German Mauser. Fritz agreed with him. Apparently, someone at the Dallas Police Department also loses things but, at least, they are more conscientious. They did replace it — even if the replacement was made in a different country. (See Warren Report for Italian Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5 Caliber). It now seems that the Mauser on the roof, which Craig didn't claim to have seen, has become the Mauser on the 6th floor. A few years later, when he was interviewed for "Two Men in Dallas," Craig claimed to have viewed the rifle close-up and seen the notation "7.65 Mauser." Tippit Shot by 1:06? The time of the Tippit shooting is an important issue, since the Warren Commission placed it at about 1:15 p.m. If Tippit was shot substantially earlier than this, it could not have been Lee Oswald who did it, since Oswald would not have had time to walk from his rooming house at 1026 North Beckley to the corner of 10th and Patton where the shooting happened. In When They Kill a President Craig claims that Tippit had to have been shot before 1:06. At that exact moment [of the discovery of the rifle] an unknown Dallas police officer came running up the stairs and advised Capt. Fritz that a Dallas policeman had been shot in the Oak Cliff area. I instinctively looked at my watch. The time was 1:06 p.m. A token force of uniformed officers was left to keep the sixth floor secure and Fritz, Day, Boone, Mooney, Weitzman and I left the building. The first problem with this is that the rifle was in fact discovered about 1:22 p.m. (7H109). Yet Craig describes the officer announcing the death of Tippit after the discovery of the rifle. But another problem is the fact that this "1:06 p.m." account seems to be a late addition to his story. In the March 1968 Los Angeles Free Press is an interview with Craig and Penn Jones: RC: Tippit went to Oak Cliff, and subsequently was killed. Why he went to Oak Cliff I can't tell you; I can only make an observation. He was going to meet somebody. FP: Do you know what time he was killed? RC: It was about 1:40 — PJ: No, I think it was a little before 1:15. RC: Was it? PJ: Yes, Bill Alexander — RC: Oh, that's right. The broadcast was put out shortly after 1:15 on Tippit's killer, and it had not been put out yet on Oswald as the assassin of President Kennedy. So Craig, rather than saying that he knew that Tippit had been killed before 1:06, estimates it was at 1:40 — and then accepts Penn Jones' correction that it was "a little before 1:15."

The video clip to the right, from Craig's 1974 video "Two Men in Dallas," has Craig saying that he and Sheriff's Deputy Luke Mooney together discovered the spent cartridges in the Sniper's Nest. Compare the 1974 interview with Craig's testimony before the Warren Commission . Mr. BELIN - Why did you go up on the sixth floor? Mr. CRAIG - Well, someone said that’s where the shots came from. One of the city officers, if I’m not mistaken. Mr. BELIN - All right. Mr. CRAIG - So, we went to the sixth floor where – uh – some empty cartridges were found. Mr. BELIN - Did you see the empty cartridges when they were found? Mr. CRAIG - I didn’t see them when they were found. I saw them laying on the floor. Mr. BELIN - About how soon after they were found did you see them, laying on the floor? Mr. CRAIG - Oh, a couple of minutes. I went right on over there. I was at the far north end of the building. The cartridges were on the southeast corner. Mr. BELIN - Well, how did you know they had been found there? Did someone yell – or what? Mr. CRAIG - Yes; someone yelled across the room that “here’s the shells.” Mr. BELIN - Do you remember who that was? Mr. CRAIG - No; I couldn’t recognize the voice. Some Conspiracists Didn't Believe Craig Mary Ferrell was an icon among conspiracy-oriented researchers (and highly respected among people who didn't believe in a conspiracy. She had considerable personal interaction with Craig, an in an early 1990s post on the old Prodigy discussion board, explained the man . TIME: 8/24 1:25 PM TO: BILL AMBROSINO FROM: MARY FERRELL SUBJECT: JFK-CIA EXPERTISE I knew Roger Craig for several years before his death. It is my belief that Roger was a very sick young man. He had made a name for himself as a very promising young law enforcement officer. When he came forward with some of the "stories" he told following the events of that November weekend, he believed that he would be offered a great deal of money and, possibly, speaking engagements. I am very sorry to say that I am one of the few conspiracy nuts who never believed Roger Craig. When Roger made a number of speeches about the fact that "they" prevented him from getting a job, I talked my husband into giving him a job. Roger did not want to work. He wanted people to give him money because he had "seen something or other." I have made enemies because I have continued to say that I have never really believed him. Mary Ferrell Roger Craig also charged that his Warren Commission testimony had been altered or tampered with. While most conspiracists will readily believe such charges, another icon among conspiracy researchers, Harold Weisberg, strongly rejected his claims . Roger Craig may be a brave guy and all of that, but he is also full of what is generally reserved for toilets. I have gone over his annotation of his testimony, as printed, and his account of the changes is utterly impossible. I spent too many years working with court reporters, particularly, the firm the Commission used, to find it possible to credit this in any way. More, have traced that testimony all the way from Dallas to the Government Printing Office, and it is printed as it was taken down, I have copies of the typescript sent to the GPO, and I have the letter of transmittal to DC the bills for taking it, the whole story. Roger is, despite Penn's [Penn Jones] great love for him, at best simply wrong, in the newer areas, what he embellished his original testimony with. Now I have met Roger, and he is a finelooking, clean-cut kind of guy who appears to be truthful, serious and all that-just like dozens of guys I once guarded in an Army locked ward in a large mental institution. He does not impress me as the kind of guy who is out to make trouble. But he is. You might want to read Craig's unpublished biography, When They Kill a President . It details his claims of Warren Commission distortion of his testimony, his firing from the Dallas County Sheriff's office, and the Garrison investigation. A Mysterious Death? Given the "interesting" stories that Roger Craig was telling, it might seem quite logical that a conspiracy would want to silence him. So Craig's death at age 39 in 1975 by suicide (conspiracy books usually put quotes around "suicide") might seem suspicious. But do the details of his death actually seem suspicious?

Dr. Charles Crenshaw -- Telling the Truth about the Kennedy Assassination? The Long Suppressed Truth? Or a Bunch of Fibs? D r. Charles Crenshaw's book Conspiracy of Silence caused a minor sensation when it was released in 1992, even attracting the attention of the New York Times . Coauthored by Jens Hansen and Gary Shaw, it told several conspiratorial stories about the assassination, and especially about the role of Dr. Crenshaw, then a resident physician at Parkland Hospital, in the care of John Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald. It has since been reprinted as Trauma Room One . Among the "interesting" things that Crenshaw claims are: The back of Kennedy's head was blown out, clearly implying a shot from the Grassy Knoll in front of Kennedy. A small wound in Kennedy's throat was an entrance wound, proving a shot from the front, and not from the Sniper's Nest behind Kennedy. Parkland doctors, knowing there was a conspiracy, have feared to speak out. The President's body was altered between Parkland Hospital and the autopsy at Bethesda. And the most sensational: Lyndon Johnson called the operating room were Oswald was being treated and demanded a confession be extracted from the accused assassin. Conspiracy authors, wanting to push the idea of a shot from the Grassy Knoll, have lapped up Crenshaw's account. For example, Gary Aguilar quotes Crenshaw as follows: He, with co-authors, Jens Hansen and Gary Shaw, recently published a book, "Conspiracy of Silence" (Crenshaw, CA, Hansen, J, Shaw, G. "Conspiracy of Silence". 1992, New York, Signet). Crenshaw has claimed both in his book and in public interviews that the President's head wound was posterior on the right side. In "Conspiracy of Silence" he wrote, "I walked to the President's head to get a closer look. His entire right cerebral hemisphere appeared to be gone. It looked like a crater—an empty cavity. " C onspiracy writer Gary Aguilar accepts Crenshaw's account. His essay on supposed "back of the head" witnesses is useful and interesting — although many of his assessments of the testimony are to be treated skeptically. How does Crenshaw know such things? According to the book, he had a central role in treating Kennedy. Yet when the New York Times called up Crenshaw in reponse to his book, he backed away from the book's claims as to how central he was, saying that Hansen and Shaw "took poetic license" on this issue. Crenshaw "admitted . . .that the role he played in Kennedy's case was minor." See the Times of May 26, 1992. It hardly inspires confidence in the book when Crenshaw says things like this. Aguilar then quotes the following passage, where Crenshaw further described the wound: All I could see there was mangled, bloody tissue. From the damage I saw, there was no doubt in my mind that the bullet had entered his head through the front, and as it surgically passed through his cranium, the missile obliterated part of the temporal and all the parietal and occipital lobes before it lacerated the cerebellum. (Emphasis added, p. 86). In the first place, as Hank Sienzant has pointed out, Crenshaw cites several descriptions of the head wound in his book, and they are far from being "back of the head" descriptions: Pg 2: "The entire right hemisphere of President Kennedy's brain was obliterated. . . . " Pg 78: "Then I noticed that the entire right hemisphere of his brain was missing, beginning at his hairline and extending all the way behind his right ear." Pg 86: "His entire right cerebral hemisphere appeared to be gone. It looked like a crater, an empty cavity." Pg 87: (Quoting Kemp Clark): "My God, the whole right side of his head is shot off... We've got nothing to work with." Pg 89: "... there is still nothing that can save a victim who loses the entire right side of his brain." In some passages (see p. 132), Crenshaw says that the damage extended around to the back. But his description is mostly "side." Even more striking is Crenshaw's claim that there was "no doubt in his mind" about the trajectory being front-to-back. Compare this to other, more senior doctors, in the ER. In another part of the essay, Aguilar quotes Ronald Jones: Specter asked Jones to speculate from his observations the nature of JFK's wounding. He asked, "Dr. Jones, did you have any speculative thought as to accounting for the point of wounds (sic) which you observed on the President, as you thought about it when you were treating the President that day, or shortly thereafter?" Jones answered, "With no history as to the number of times that the President had been shot or knowing the direction from which he had been shot, and seeing the wound in the midline of the neck, and what appeared to be an exit wound in the posterior portion of the skull, the only speculation that I could have as far as to how this could occur with a single wound would be that it would enter the anterior neck and possibly strike a vertebral body and then change its course and exit in the region of the posterior portion of the head." (WC.V.6:56) And then there was Paul Peters: Peters told author Lifton on 11-12-66, "I was trying to think how he could have had a hole in his neck and a hole in the occiput, and the only answer we could think (of) was perhaps the bullet had gone in through the front, hit the bony spinal column, and exited through the back of the head, since a wound of exit is always bigger than a wound of entry." (Lifton D. Best Evidence. p317. Peters repeated this speculation in a speech on the subject on 4/2/92, in a talk entitled, "Who Killed JFK?", given at the 14th annual meeting of the Wilk- Amite Medical Society, at Centreville Academy, Centreville, Mississippi, according to a transcript furnished by Claude B. Slaton, of Zachary, Louisiana.) So while doctors like Jones and Peters were engaging in rather wild speculation as to the trajectory Crenshaw, a very junior bit player, had "no doubt." In fact, nobody at Parkland could offer more than a wild guess about the trajectory, since nobody did (or had any need to do) the sort of forensic examination that would have allowed determining trajectory. Crenshaw's assurance here is necessarily bogus, and detracts from his credibility. Conspiracy of Silence? Then there is Crenshaw's "Conspiracy of Silence" thesis. For Crenshaw: Every doctor who was in Trauma Room 1 had his own reasons for not publicly refuting the 'official line' . . . . I believe there was a common denominator in our silence — a fearful perception that to come forward with what we believed to be the medical truth would be asking for trouble. . . . Whatever was happening was larger than any of us. I reasoned that anyone who would go so far as to eliminate the President of the United States would surely not hesitate to kill a doctor. (pp. 153-154.) This is almost breathtaking in its absurdity. Crenshaw published a book in 1992 claiming he was breaking a "conspiracy of silence." Yet the other Parkland doctors had been talking their heads off for nearly 30 years by this time. Many have talked to conspiracy authors like Groden, Lifton and Livingstone. Their statements can be seen in books like Six Seconds in Dallas , High Treason , High Treason II , and Best Evidence . They can be seen in videos such as The Men Who Killed Kennedy , Bob Groden's The Case for Conspiracy , and NOVA's Who Shot JFK ? Most have given statements that — if they have been quoted accurately — imply a conspiracy. The conspiracy writers (including Gary Aguilar) know this, because the have been quoting these doctors extensively! If the thesis of the book is bogus, the details aren't any better. In the first place, the book is littered with silly conspiracy book factoids. To give just a very few examples: The Julia Ann Mercer story (p. 55). The claim that seventy-five percent of the witnesses in Dealey Plaza who identified the source of the shots said they came from the Grassy Knoll (p. 66). Crenshaw accepts Seth Kantor's testimony that Ruby was at Parkland Hospital about 1:30 (p. 108). This is perfectly reasonable, but then Crenshaw reports that Jack Ruby was in the Texas Theater at the time of the Oswald arrest! (p. 117) Although this doesn't exactly put Ruby in two places at one time, it implies an absurd mad dash by Ruby from the Dallas Morning News to Parkland Hospital to the Texas Theater and back to the Carousel club (where he returned about 2:00 pm.) in well under an hour. Crenshaw recounts how Dallas cops and Federal agents descended on the Texas Theater "all to capture a man suspected of entering the theater without paying" (p. 115). Jack Ruby's correcting DA Wade about Oswald's role in the "Fair Play for Cuba" committee indicated he was "a person very familiar with Cuban politics" (p. 145). The bogus Bobby Kennedy "only the powers of the presidency" quote (p. 138). All these silly conspiracy factoids could be blamed on Crenshaw's conspiracy-oriented coauthors Shaw and Hansen. But Crenshaw's own supposed account (it's set in a sans-serif typeface) is full of Crenshaw's claims to have seen things that he could not in fact have seen. As Roger Bynum has pointed out, Crenshaw provides the following tidbit about his actions on the morning of the assassination: Having visited all my patients, I went to the dining room on the first floor, and was eating two hardboiled eggs, toast, and coffee while reading the newspaper. The Dallas Morning News was full of information and stories about President Kennedy and the First Lady. . . . With sickening clarity, I recall a full-page editorial purchased by an extremist group that viciously attacked the integrity of President Kennedy by claiming he was a Communist. The President was posed in a frontal and side mug shot atop the message, "This man is wanted for treasonous activities against the United States." The article further claimed President Kennedy was " . . . turning the sovereignty of the U.S. over to the communist controlled United Nations." p. 33 But Crenshaw could have seen no such editorial, since none existed! The ad attacking Kennedy in the Dallas Morning News was quite different from Crenshaw's description. It was headlined (sarcastically) "Welcome Mr. Kennedy." Crenshaw provides an accurate description of a handbill that was distributed in the Dallas area. Here is the handbill. Here is the advertisement. Is this issue — handbill versus advertisement — one that could be easily confused? Yes, if you are getting your information from reading books on the assassination. But Crenshaw claims that he remembers "with sickening clarity" an ad in the Dallas Morning News which never appeared! This raises the issue of other things he claims to remember "clearly." For example, Crenshaw claims he literally ran to the Emergency Room with Dr. McClelland, and that he and McClelland approached Dr. Perry (who was already treating Kennedy) together. See pages 73-78. He describes the head wound, and then recounts: I also identified a small opening about the diameter of a pencil at the midline of his throat to be an entry bullet hole. There was no doubt in my mind about that wound. I had seen dozens of them in the emergency room. At that point, I knew that he had been shot at least twice. (p. 79) Unfortunately for Crenshaw, McClelland told the Warren Commission that the tracheostomy was already begun and the throat wound obliterated when he arrived. The following is from 6H32: Mr. SPECTER. What did you observe, if anything, as to the status of the neck wound when you first arrived? Dr. McCLELLAND. The neck wound, when I first arrived, was at this time converted into a tracheotomy incision. The skin incision had been made by Dr. Perry, and he told me—although I did not see that—that he had made the incision through a very small, perhaps less than one quarter inch in diameter wound in the neck. Perry confirmed McClelland's account when he told the Warren Commission that, at the time he began the tracheostomy, McClelland was not present and he (Perry) instructed that he be called (3H369). He also said that McClelland arrived "shortly after" he had entered the neck (3H370). Further, Perry said that he and Carrico were the only people who saw the unaltered wound, and McClelland did not see the wound (3H377). So either Crenshaw's claim to have entered the ER with McClelland is untrue, or his claim to have seen the unaltered neck wound is untrue. Since McClelland confirms that he entered the Emergency Room with Crenshaw (6H31), it seems that Cranshaw gave a vivid description of a throat wound he never saw. Crenshaw the Liftonite Crenshaw and his coauthor Gary Shaw was interviewed by Jim Bohannon in 1993 Click on the link below to hear the interview. Instead of going on and on about silly conspiracy-book factoids that Crenshaw repeats, it might be good to focus on one particular class of factoids that Crenshaw repeats. Those of David Lifton. 1. Crenshaw recounts how J. Gary Shaw showed him photos from the JFK autopsy. He says: "I was amazed. . . . One picture showed President Kennedy's neck at the point where the bullet had entered, the spot where Dr. Malcolm Perry had performed a tracheostomy at Parkland to help the President breathe. The opening was larger and jagged — significantly different from the way it looked to me in Dallas. There was no doubt in my mind — someone had tampered with the body, or the photographs." (p. 10-11) He continues: "After studying the pictures for several more moments, I said, "No, these aren't the wounds I saw at Parkland. From these pictures it appears that someone performed some surgery on the President between the time his body left Parkland Hospital and when these photographs were taken." (p. 11). He returns to this theme on page 111, when he again discusses looking at the autopsy photos, at which point he " . . . realized there was something rotten in America in 1963. . . . Great effort had been made to reconstruct the back of the President's head, and the incision Perry had made in his throat at Parkland had been enlarged and mangled, as if someone had conducted another procedure. It looked to be the work of a butcher." 2. Crenshaw says the body left Parkland in "a bronze casket . . . wrapped in white cloth" but arrived at Bethesda in "a gray shipping casket, not swaddled in white cloth, but instead zipped in a body bag like the ones from Vietnam" (pp. 11-12). He repeats this story on page 111. 3. Crenshaw tells about a medical student who saw a bullet hole in the windshield (p. 105). 4. He says that " . . . there were two eyewitnesses present at the autopsy, James Jenkins and Paul O'Connor, who swear that President Kennedy arrived at the Naval medical facility zipped in a gray body bag . . . . And even more astounding, these men, who have gone through numerous tests and substantial harrassment to be proved credible, claim there was no brain when the body came out of the gray bag. As the last doctor to see President Kennedy before the body left Parkland, I can unequivocally report that there was no gray body bag, and that he still had the left side of his brain." pp. 111-112. All these are part of author David Lifton's "body alteration" hypothesis. Lifton, in Best Evidence , claims that Kennedy's body was stolen between Parkland Hospital and the autopsy at Bethesda and his wounds surgically altered to conceal shots from the front. If this sounds absurd it's because it is absurd, and few if any among even conspiracy authors believe it — except for Crenshaw. The Supposed Call from LBJ The most explosive claim made by Crenshaw is that Lyndon Johnson called the ER during the attempt to save Oswald's life, and demanded that a confession be extracted from Oswald. Supposedly, the confession would be taken by an "Oliver Hardy" figure who was standing by in the ER. Aside from being absurd on its face, Crenshaw has credibility problems on several fronts with this claim: 1. The White House phone logs do not show any call from LBJ to Parkland Hospital that day. See: Case Closed , paperback, p. 396. 2. Lyndon Johnson would not have been able to make a phone call at the time Crenshaw describes. The operation on Oswald began at 11:44 Central Time. At 11:55 Central Time, Manchester ( The Death of a President ) notes that the Kennedys and the Johnsons met in the East Room of the White House and then proceeded to the ceremonies moving Kennedy's body from the White House to the Capitol. But Crenshaw explicitly said the phone call came a little under an hour into the operation (p. 188). As Gary Mack explains: It has always been known that there was a call from Washington, but apparently not from LBJ as Crenshaw's book claims. My own research, conducted at the request of KXAS-TV, the NBC affiliate in Dallas, found that LBJ was in his limo at the very moment Crenshaw's book indicates the call came in. There is no record of any such radiotelephone call which, according to the procedures in place, would have to have been routed to Dallas through the White House switchboard where all calls were logged. Nor is there an account from any of the people in the car that LBJ said "Excuse me, I have to call the hospital." And there would certainly be no need to keep such an event, if it happened, secret. (Post on newsgroup alt.assassination.jfk on 10/9/98.) 3. Crenshaw claims (p. 188) that he told Shires about the call in the ER immediately after it was made. But neither Shires nor any of the other doctors there have ever mentioned such a statement. Crenshaw supporters claim corroboration of Crenshaw's tale from a Doctor Phillip Williams. According to the New York Times of May 26, 1992, Williams said that he remembered reports of two White House telephone calls to the operating room. Quoting Williams: "I vividly remember someone said, and I can't say who it was, the White House is calling and President Johnson wants to know what the status of Oswald is." It's interesting that Crenshaw supporters claim "corroboration" when this account flatly contradicts Crenshaw's! It does not confirm LBJ personally calling, and is not about getting a confession. According to the Times : " . . . Dr. Williams said he had never heard that Johnson wanted to get a confession. He also said he did not know whether it was Johnson or an aide who spoke on the phone." It seems unlikely that anything as memorable as a demand for a confession would be forgotten — if it actually happened. Crenshaw supporters have cited one Phyllis Bartlett, telephone operator at Parkland, who claims that a man who identified himself as Lyndon Johnson called Parkland during the time Oswald was in surgery, and she patched him through to the operating room. Given Johnson's whereabouts, this is vastly implausible. And there is another problem with her story. As Gary Mack explains: Parkland asked its personnel to write reports of their activities that weekend, and they are here in our collection [at the Sixth Floor Museum] and in the documents we duplicated for the ARRB. Neither Crenshaw, Bartlett or anyone else mentioned that there was either a call from LBJ or a call from Washington. They did mention getting more than a few crank calls, though. (Newsgroup post on alt.assassination.jfk , 10/15/98) As wild as Crenshaw's most recent story is, it appears to have been toned down compared to the original. Harrison Livingstone, for example, has claimed that the first version of Crenshaw's manuscript had Johnson calling and demanding, not that Oswald be gotten to confess, but that Oswald be killed. The Kennedy Assassination Home Page has been unable to confirm the existence of that manuscript, but the early version of the story was as Livingstone describes. One of the researchers who was privy to this early version was Gus Russo, author of Live By The Sword . As Russo describes it: When Oliver Stone was in Dallas prepping for JFK, a number of us were around as "technical advisors," which was a bit of a joke, since Stone only listened to people with crazy conspiracy info. One night at the Stoneleigh [Hotel], Stone was having a slew of top secret meetings in his suite with people like Ricky White, whom Stone paid $80,000 for his fraudulent story, and the positively goofy Beverly Oliver. That night, Stone ushered Gary Shaw, [Robert] Groden and Crenshaw into his room; I was not invited, but I pressed Shaw (Crenshaw's and Oliver's advisor) for info in the lobby. He was the first to tell me that LBJ ordered Oswald killed. Later, Crenshaw came down, and we happened to be in the Stoneleigh men's room at the same time, standing at adjacent urinals. It was there that he told me that Johnson had ordered the Parkland staff to "kill the son-of-a-bitch." It was decided to "drown Oswald in his own blood," i.e. transfuse him until his lungs collapsed. (E-mail to the author dated August 25, 2003) In addition to Gus Russo, we have Harrison Edward Livingstone ( Killing the Truth , p. 607), who oddly enough seems to believe Crenshaw. Livingstone cites "discussions" with Crenshaw for Crenshaw's early claim that LBJ demanded that Oswald be killed. And finally, we have Gary Mack reporting that Jane Rusconi, Oliver Stone’s research coordinator, confirmed the early version with LBJ wanting Oswald killed . Thus is appears that Crenshaw's absurdly incredible early version was tempered in an attempt to make it more credible. With many devout conspiracy believers, the tactic succeeded. For others, Crenshaw merely added to the long list of witnesses whose tall tales litter the assassination landscape. Return to Kennedy Assassination Home Page

Dealey Plaza and the Grassy Knoll Dealey Plaza S tep into Dealey Plaza, and you feel you are on sacred ground. No, it doesn't matter that you may be a hard-bitten believer in Oswald's sole guilt. It does not matter that you believe that the assassination was an historical fluke, with no particular larger significance. This is The Place where all assassination buffs, conspiracists and lone-nutters alike, have to go. This is the necessary pilgrimage. Dealey Plaza has changed a bit since 1963. The famous Stemmons Freeway sign is gone, and the Hertz car rental sign is gone from atop the Depository. Some of the train tracks over the Triple Underpass have been replaced with electrified commuter rail tracks, and the parking lot behind the Stockade Fence is now paved. A plaque now defaces the grass between the Pergola and Elm Street. Otherwise, it's pretty much the same place, The Place . The Lay of the Land This high resolution CAD rendering of Dealey Plaza shows the salient features of the Plaza, which was a WPA project at the edge of Dallas' downtown. Done by Paul Burke, it is included here by permission. History and Dealey Plaza The history of this unique piece of ground is put into perspective in two essays by Jerry Organ: A history of Dealey Plaza , from the founding of Dallas by John Neely Bryan through the WPA project in the 1930s that created the Plaza to the 1960s when Dallas was unfairly labelled the "City of Hate." A history of the Texas School Book Depository , which has served as a plow factory, a wholesale grocery warehouse, and textbook distribution center, and (most recently) a museum. Where Did the Term "Grassy Knoll" Come From? Lots of people claim to have invented the term "Grassy Knoll," but only one man did. Here is the scoop from Gary Mack, Curator of the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza . I'll give you a hint: it wasn't Jean Hill. The Knoll at the Time of the Shooting Tons of "suspicious" goings on: The "Black Dog Man," "Badgeman," the "rush to the Knoll" by witnesses in the wake of the shooting, and "smoke on the Knoll." These are all topics dealt with in "'Smoke' on the Grassy Knoll" by Jerry Organ. "But there were all those witnesses who heard shots from the Grassy Knoll, weren't there?" Yes, according to Oliver Stone and the conspiracy books. But just what does a careful tabulation of the earwitness testimony show? Click here to check out various tabulations, including the definitive one from the House Select Committee. The Three Tramps They don't look sinister in the photos : the three hobos arrested in a train yard near Dealey Plaza in the wake of the assassination. But if you have a very active imagination, and if you are quite convinced that there must have been sinister goings-on in and around Dealey Plaza, the tramps can look very suspicious indeed. But in reality, there is no longer any mystery surrounding the three men . The Tague Wounding One of the ongoing mysteries of Dealey Plaza is the origin of the fragment that hit James Tague. Three graphics images, all rendered Autocad drawings, test two scenarios. First is Posner's theory that a shot at about Zapruder frame 160 was deflected off a branch of the Live Oak in front of the Depository and hit the curb in front of Tague. The other theory is that a fragment of the head shot hit Tague. TAGUE1.GIF , TAGUE2.GIF , and TAGUE3.GIF show the trajectories involved. TAGUE4.GIF deals with the same issue, but this time the drawing is from conspiracy author Josiah Thompson. The diagram, drawn on a map of Dealey Plaza, shows the path a fragment from the head shot would have to have taken to hit Tague. Warning: this file is extremely large for screen viewing, and you may prefer to download it and print it. Tague's own testimony is interesting — although not capable of resolving all the issues his wounding raises. Bill Goggins interviewed Tague in 1997, and discusses his recent testimony and Warren Commission statements in "James Tague: Unintended Victim in Dealey Plaza." Goggins debunks one minor, but widely cited, error regarding Tague's wounding. A lead smear on the Main Street curb near where Tague was standing may — or may not — have something to do with the shooting. Oswald in the Doorway of the Depository During the Shooting? It's the conspiracy factoid that won't die: the image of a man — supposedly Lee Oswald — in the doorway of the Book Depository during the shooting in Dealey Plaza. Debunking this notion is easy, but explaining why a fair number of conspiracists still believe it is more difficult. "Was Oswald in the Doorway of the Depository at the time of the JFK Assassination?" lays out the evidence. A Through and Through Hole in the Limo Windshield Conspiracists have long claimed that, in the wake of the shooting, the windshield of the presidntial limo had a through and through hole in it. The windshield in evidence (in the National Archives) has only ding on the inner surface, presumably from a fragment from the shot that hit Kennedy in the head. An actual through and through hole would imply both evidence tampering and a shooter from the front of the limo, both evidence of conspiracy. However, conspiracist researchers Barb Junkkarinen, Jerry Logan, and Josiah Thompson show that there was no such hole . Your browser does not support the video tag. Back, and to the Left. Back, and to the Left. Back, and to the Left. Can a shot that hits someone in the head from behind cause the head to go backwards ? Physicist Luis Alvarez suggested that a "jet effect" with brain matter ejected from the front of the skull might produce this result. He showed it was possible using melons to simulate human skulls. Dr. John Lattimer reproduced Alvarez' results with human skulls, and with a rifle and ammunition identical to those Oswald used. The video clip at the right is from the 1988 NOVA documentary, with Walter Cronkite narrating. Experts in forensics and wound ballistics are not impressed with the idea that a bullet from the Grassy Knoll could have driven Kennedy's head back and to the left. That's just not the way it works. Here are two essays dealing with this issue from researcher Joel Grant: A compilation of expert witness testimony , including seldom-seen testimony before the Rockefeller Commission. An interview with ballistics expert Duncan MacPherson , a rocket scientist (literally) who has done innovative work computer modelling the effects of bullet strikes on the human body. Cyril Wecht is a forensic pathologist who believes that Kennedy's "back and to the left" motion indicates a shot from the Grassy Knoll. But when called as a expert witness in the Menendez retrial, he insisted that simple Newtonian physics isn't much use in determining how people will react to a shot . Your browser does not support the video tag. It's supposed to prove that Kennedy was hit in the head by a shot from the Grassy Knoll. You know, the movement of his head back and to the left in the Zapruder film. But in fact, it's perfectly possible for an object hit by a bullet to move in the direction from which the bullet came. Richard Trott demonstrates this by shooting melons. This "jet effect" phenomenon was first suggested, and experimentally demonstrated by physicist Luis Alvarez. Trott shows that the average citizen with a rifle can recreate the effect. And we have a scholarly article in the International Journal of Legal Medicine (Volume 109, Number 23) titled "On the physics of momentum in ballistics: Can the human body be displaced or knocked down by a small arms projectile?" It says: Shooting incidents are often portrayed as resulting in a sometimes violent backwards displacement of the victim. This opinion is also not infrequently held by expert witnesses. The physical force responsible for this would be momentum (mass x velocity). The physics of momentum in ballistic injury is explained in detail. The maximum momentum transferred from different small arms projectiles including large calibre rifles and a 12-gauge shotgun only results in a backwards motion of a 80 kg target body of 0.01–0.18 m/s, which is negligible compared to the velocity of a pedestrian (1–2 m/s). Furthermore, counterbalance is constantly maintained by neurophysiological reflexes. So the effect of the momentum transferred from the missile is virtually zero and there is no backwards motion of the person shot. Empirical evidence verifying these calculations can be obtained from hunting big game, from human gunshot victims and from a video documentary demonstrating the lack of any backwards motion of a person wearing body armour after hits from a centre fire rifle. So the alleged backwards hurling of a person shot is nothing but a myth which should be refuted not only because it is incorrect but also because it can result in miscarriages of justice. A more recent work on the issue comes from Nicholas R. Nalli, who outlines (with all the science in place) how a shot from behind hit Kennedy in his head, forcing it forward a bit, and then a slightly delayed neuromuscular reaction threw him back, and then to the left. The TV show "Mythbusters" addressed this issue, not in the context of the assassination, but in the context of cheesy Hollywood stunts. Their finding: even a .50 caliber high-velocity bullet from a sniper's rifle cannot throw a human figure back more than a couple of inches. Some basic data: a .50 caliber sniper's rifle fires BMG (Browning Machine Gun) rounds (right, above) that weigh over 600 grains with a muzzle velocity of around 3,000 feet per second. A typical hunting or sniper's rifle in 1963 fired a cartridge weighing between at most 220 grains , with a similar muzzle velocity. You can see the segment "Blown Away" here . Your browser does not support the video tag. Another explanation for Kennedy's backward jerk after the head shot is a neuromuscular spasm. The House Select Committee decided that this was the key factor after watching an experiment where a goat was shot in the head. The slow motion video they saw is to the left. In this they followed the Rockefeller Commission, which reported : Drs. Spitz, Lindenberg and Hodges reported that such a motion could be caused by violent straightening and stiffening of the entire body us a result of a seizure-like neuromuscular reaction to major damage inflicted to nerve centers in the brain. Dr. Olivier reported that experiments which have been conducted at Edgewood Arsenal disclosed that goats shot through the brain evidenced just such a violent neuromuscular reaction. There was a convulsive stiffening and extension of their legs to front and rear commencing forty milliseconds (1/25 of a second) after the bullet entered the brain. In the past two decades Dr. 0livier and his associates have conducted extensive tests on the effects of high velocity bullets fired into live animals, using high speed photography to record the results. A Wild and Wolly Scenario? Conspiracy buffs are keen to believe any story about extra shooters, extra bullets, or extra weapons around Dealey Plaza. Just where do you end up if you believe them all? An essay by Mike Griffith , from his web site, provides a nice compilation of all the "evidence" of additional shooters. Ask yourself: if all this evidence is valid, just how many assassins were blasting away at Kennedy from different directions using different weapons and different ammunition types? The question that follows is: if the vast majority of this stuff is necessarily bogus, isn't it quite possible that all of it is? Could Oswald Have Gotten the Shots Off? It's in almost every conspiracy book: the claim that Oswald could not possibly have gotten off the shots in the necessary time. Conspiracy authors always claim that Oswald had under six seconds to get three shots off — although the Warren Commission was vague on this and most contemporary lone gunman theorists believe he has about 8.5 seconds. Further, conspiracy authors exaggerate the difficulty in Oswald's "shooting feat." Craig Zirbel, in his book The Texas Connection , badly misrepresents the results of the Warren Commission's shooting tests. Compare Zirbel's account with what really happened . Your browser does not support the video tag. FBI weapons expert Robert Frazier got off three accurate shots with Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano rifle in 4.5 seconds — recycling the mechanism and reaiming the rifle twice. In this hilarious sequence — from the 1988 NOVA documentary — conspiracy author Josiah Thompson cites Frazier's results, and proceeds to cycle the mechanism of the rifle in 1.83 seconds, all the while explaining that it can't be done in under 2.3 seconds. A Revolver in "The Immediate Vicinity" of the Depository? The "extra weapon" story that was all the rage in 1994/95 involved a revolver supposedly discovered "in the immediate vicinity" of the Texas Schoolbook Depository. Anthony Summers used this in his December 1994 Vanity Fair article, for example. Researcher Bill Adams got to the bottom of this story in this article, from his Truth is Redacted web site . Adams laments: I t is amazing how fast a "new discovery" or the "re-discovery" of assassination information gets spread through the researcher community. It is also very disappointing to see how a story "gets better" each time it is told and passed on. Dealey Plaza Witnesses Abraham Zapruder Abraham Zapruder took the most famous piece of amateur motion picture film in history. His film does not show the back of Kennedy's head exploding, but rather the top, right, and front. Of course, some conspiratorialists claim the Zapruder film has been tampered with. Below is a video frame, from WFAA-TV, of Zapruder's interview with Jay Watson. He here shows where he saw Kennedy's head explode. Roger Craig Roger Craig is the guy featured in lots of conspiracy books. You remember: he saw Oswald run from the School Book Depository and get in a Rambler on Elm Street, supposedly belonging to Mrs. Paine, a few minutes after the assassination. He saw lots of other suspicious stuff too. Was it really a Rambler? Was it really Mrs. Paine's? Did a photo really show up years later to vindicate Craig? Check out this detailed analysis of his testimony . Seymour Weitzman Seymour Weitzman, the officer who first saw Oswald's rifle behind some boxes on the 6th floor of the Texas School Book Depository, said it was a Mauser, and several other officers repeated this statement. Before the Warren Commission, Weitzman said that "in a glance" the gun looked like a Mauser. This photo , taken from Six Seconds in Dallas , shows Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano beside a Mauser. So you be the judge: could someone "in a glance" mistake one rifle for the other? (Warning: this is a very large image. You may wish to download and print, rather than view it.) Regardless of what any witness said, WFAA-TV cameraman Tom Alyea was on the sixth floor of the Depository photographing the recovery of the rifle. Here is one frame from his 16 mm. film , and here is another . The rifle in the film is not merely a Mannlicher-Carcano, a distinctive mark on the gun identifies it as Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano. The same gun in the backyard photos , and the same gun that sits to this day in the National Archives. Marilyn Sitzman Among the Dealey Plaza witnesses, Marilyn Sitzman was superbly positioned to see what was going on. Standing on the same pedestal with Abraham Zapruder (and helping steady him), she was only a few yards from the supposed position of the Grassy Knoll shooter. She saw Kennedy hit in the head, and she turned to look in the direction of the Stockade Fence after the head shot. Although she did not testify before the Warren Commission, author Josiah Thompson interviewed her. Here is a transcript of that interview. Julia Ann Mercer Mercer's story, featured in the movie "JFK" involves seeing Jack Ruby at the wheel of a pickup truck near the Triple Underpass just a couple of hours before the assassination. She claimed another man took a gun case from the back of the pickup and walked up a grassy incline toward the Grassy Knoll. Did that really happened? Jean Hill Jean Hill is the woman in the red raincoat, plainly visible in the movies and still photos of Dealey Plaza. She has always had interesting stories to tell, from seeing a little dog in the limo between Jack and Jackie Kennedy, to her current claim to have seen a Grassy Knoll shooter in the act of shooting. How consistent has her testimony been? How does it accord with other evidence? Tom Tilson Tom Tilson tells of seeing a man scrambling down the bank behind the Grassy Knoll on the west side of the Triple Underpass immediately following the assassination, putting an object (a rifle?) in a car, and driving off. Might this be the Grassy Knoll shooter? Or might Tom Tilson be telling tall tales? Peter Whitmey examines the credibility of Tilson in this article , reprinted from Back Channels . Phil Willis You can see Phil Willis in the conspiracy videos claiming that the back of Kennedy's head was blown out. He even puts his hand on the back of his head to show where he supposedly saw Kennedy's head explode. His Warren Commission testimony is a bit different. Jackie Kennedy Jackie Kennedy is widely quoted in assassination books as a witness who claimed to have seen a wound on the back of Kennedy's head. Here is her account of the terror of Dealey Plaza, as told to Theodore White. It provides an interesting supplement to her Warren Commission testimony. Rufus Youngblood Secret Service Agent Rufus W. Youngblood was in Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination, protecting Vice President Johnson. In 1992 Gary Goettling, a writer for the alumni magazine of Georgia Tech, interviewed him. The assassination related portions of the resulting article, "Eyewitness to the Death of a President" , are now available. Texas Monthly Witnesses On the 35th Anniversary of the assassination, the Texas Monthly interviewed several key witnesses, and published the unedited transcripts on their web site. The witnesses are Bill and Gayle Newman, Pierce Allman, Bobby Hargis, Rosemary Willis Roach, James Leavelle, Waggoner Carr, Nellie Connally, and Red Duke. Interesting material indeed, although 35 year old testimony can't be as reliable as contemporaneous testimony. Ed Hoffman Ed Hoffman is a deaf mute who was on the Stemmons Freeway onramp at the time of the shooting. He now claims to have seen two men behind the Stockade Fence, one firing a shot at Kennedy and another disassembling the gun. FBI documents from the 1960s don't show him mentioning any shooter. Is this an FBI "coverup," miscommunication, or yet another witness who has changed his story? See Ed Hoffman: Did He See a Grassy Knoll Shooter? "Dealey Plaza Witnesses" Who Weren't in the Plaza? Many Dealey Plaza films and photos show a figure dubbed "the Babushka Lady" standing on the south side of Elm, filming the assassination with what appears to be a movie camera. A woman named Beverly Oliver has come forward, claiming to have been the Babushka Lady, and telling a variety of interesting stories about Dealey Plaza, Jack Ruby, and Lee Oswald. Just how credible is Oliver? Gordon Arnold, a key figure in the often broadcast documentary "The Men Who Killed Kennedy," claimed to have been on the Grassy Knoll during the shooting, to have heard a shot whiz past his left ear, and to have been confronted by a man who confiscated his camera. Is he credible, or just another teller of tall tales? A New View of Old Evidence Martin Shackleford thought it would be interesting to have a couple of professional lip readers carefully scrutinize the Zapruder film. The essay that resulted, "Listening to the Zapruder Film," seems rather modest and insignificant when read in isolation. In conjunction with careful study of the contradictory testimony of John and Nellie Connally, and of the Zapruder film, it puts a key piece of the puzzle in place. This first appeared in the March 1987 issue of The Third Decade . Another "new view" of the Zapruder film is made possible of a new video version, made from high-resolution scans and including the area between the sprocket holes. Now, the Zapruder film is history's greatest Rorschach test. People see all kinds of things in it, many of them downright wacky. But careful study really does yield insights about the assassination, as this essay by Steve Barber shows. The history of the Zapruder film, as well as a discussion of what it shows about John Kennedy's wounds and reactions, can be found in this essay by Jerry Organ . What Can We Learn from the Damage to the Limo? In "Best Witness: JFK's Limousine" researcher Tony Marsh works on the premise that witness testimony is unreliable, but that the damage to the presidential limo is the sort of hard physical evidence that can be relied upon. See what a detailed look at the damage to the presidential limousine shows about the shooting. Grassy Knoll Shooter: Blowing Smoke You may have seen it in the movie "JFK:" smoke from a shot fired by a Grassy Knoll shooter floats out from the Stockade Fence on the Knoll. But watch this segment closely, and you'll see something interesting: Your browser does not support the video tag. Conspiracy authors seldom fail to discuss several witnesses who saw "smoke," or "steam," or "motorcycle exhaust" on the Grassy Knoll. Of course, they forget the "steam" and "motorcycle exhaust" and present all the witnesses as having seen smoke from a rifle. But just how much smoke do modern rifles produce? One clue comes from the movie JFK . Director Oliver Stone could not find a rifle that would emit the necessary cloud of smoke when fired, and so he resorted to having a special-effects man blow smoke from a bellows . Many consider this an appropriate metaphor for the entire movie. The Smell of "Gunpowder" in the Plaza Conspiracy authors also mention several witnesses who said they smelled gunpower in Dealey Plaza in the wake of the shooting. This is claimed to prove a Grassy Knoll shooter, since supposedly smoke from the Sniper's Nest could not have drifted down into the Plaza. But one witness who was a hundred yards upwind of the Plaza smelled "gunpowder." Either the smell of shots can travel further than we assume, or (more likely) witnesses didn't smell gunpowder at all. New Film Evidence? Recent media attention has been focused on a film shot in Dealey Plaza, at the time of the assassination, by Patsy Paschall. Does the film show evidence of a shooter on the Grassy Knoll? Dallas researcher Greg Jaynes, in this essay , gives a thorough rundown of the film's content. A Secret Service Man on the Knoll? Officer Joe Marshall Smith, who was on the Grassy Knoll behind the Stockade Fence after the shooting, was convinced that he encountered a Secret Service agent. But the Secret Service claimed to have no agents in Dealey Plaza immediately after the shooting. Was this a conspirator assigned to protect the escape of a shooter? Researcher Chris Mills suggests a different possibility in this essay . The standard conspiracy position — that the "Secret Service man" was a conspirator — is expressed in this essay by Michael T. Griffith . Written in response to Mills essay (above), it's on the JFK Lancer web site . A less conspiratorial view of Officer Smith's encounter with the "Secret Service man" is given by the House Select Committee, and by author Gerald Posner. There was, it seems, plenty of room for simple mistaken identity. Acoustic Evidence of Four Shots? T hat's what the House Select Committee on Assassinations claimed, based on impulses on a Dallas Police Dictabelt tape. Supposedly, one set of "impulses" showed a shot from the Grassy Knoll. But this supposedly "scientific" evidence of conspiracy didn't survive the scrutiny of the best scientists, who gathered under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences, and declared the acoustic analysis to be bad science. And it also didn't survive the scrutiny of an amateur but highly perceptive researcher named Steve Barber, who discovered something about the Dictabelt that the House Committee's high-priced consultants had not noticed. It's a story about the misuse of science, and of the taxpayers' money. A Slug Discovered on the Dealey Plaza Infield? It's a staple of conspiracy books: the story of a .45 caliber slug that was supposedly recovered by a mysterious government agent from the grass on the south side of Elm Street. Supposedly, this discovery and suppression of evidence is recorded in photos of the scene. As usual, the reality is a lot less sinister . The Umbrella Man Was this fellow, standing in Dealey Plaza with an open umbrella and no rain in sight part of some conspiracy? The House Select Committee on Assassinations located the Umbrella Man — a fellow named Louis Witt who was engaged in a somewhat obscure form of political protest. Here are two graphics, one showing Louis Witt's umbrella being opened before the House Select Committee on Assassinations, to the general merriment of all assembled. The second shows the Umbrella Man's umbrella in the Zapruder film in Dealey Plaza. Both of these images are video captures from the NOVA documentary. Here is the first one , and here is the second . Some conspiratorialists claim that the umbrellas are different, having a different number of spokes. Decide for yourself. What was the point of the umbrella in Dealey Plaza? Apparently it was an attempt to heckle Kennedy with a reminder of the appeasement policies of British Prime Minister Nevill Chamberlain, whose weak posture toward Hitler was supported by Kennedy's father. Sounds pretty obscure to us today. But this 1930s British cartoon links the umbrella (Chamberlain's trademark) with weakness toward Nazism. One of the more bizarre theories about The Umbrella man comes from Robert Cutler. Cutler claimed that the umbrella was a weapon firing a flechette (poisoned dart) that hit Kennedy in the throat, paralyzing Kennedy to set him up for the head shot. Here is Cutler's drawing of this concept . The Limo Slowed When the Shooting Started Conspiracy-oriented author Vince Palamara provides an extensive list of sources that show that Kennedy's limo slowed or stopped after the shooting started on Elm Street. Does this indicate Zapruder film fakery, Secret Service involvement in a plot, or poor performance on the part of driver William Greer? Read it, and decide. Return to Kennedy Assassination Home Page

Kennedy Assassination Evidence Tampering by the Dallas Cops? Dallas Police Evidence Tampering? I t's supposed to prove evidence tampering on the part of the Dallas Police Department. At right is a page from Anthony Summers' book Conspiracy . At the top of the page is a photograph of the the backyard of General Edwin Walker, the right-wing political activist who Oswald tried to kill. As is obvious, the license plate of one of the cars parked behind Walker's house has been torn out. Who tore it out? The Warren Commission believed Oswald did. But conspiracy authors have pointed to a Dallas Police photo of evidence from the Paine residence laid out on the floor. See the bottom of the image at right. The Oswald photo is included among this evidence, and the license plate is supposedly intact in this photo. This shows, it's claimed, that the plate was torn out after the "evidence" photo was made, while the Walker backyard photo was in the possession of the Dallas Police. Summers asks, with sinister intonation, "what could have been the motive for concealing the plate?" Of course, we might ask Summers how this would indicate a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. The most obvious reason for concealing the plate would be that someone in the Dallas Police Department was embarrassed about his own or a friend's association with Walker. And we might ask why the Dallas cops didn't simply make the photo disappear entirely. But one is not supposed to ask such questions of conspiracy authors. Of course, if one looks carefully at the low resolution version of the photo printed on conspiracy books, it's really not clear that the license plate is intact. You can't see that it has been torn out, but you can't see that it's there either. What do we find if we look at a higher resolution version? It happens that the Texas State Library and Archives Commission has a first generation print of this evidence picture, and they have done a special blowup of the area that shows Oswald's photo of the back of Walker's house. Here it is: A jagged area suggests that the plate has already been torn out. An even larger blowup (below) shows that indeed the license plate is missing in the "evidence" photo. The photo is laying on a notebook, rather than on a black background, but the outline of a tear that matches the Warren Commission version of the photo is visible. S o it seem that, yet again, conspiracy authors have jumped to conclusions based on poor quality photographic evidence. Dale Myers brought the photo in the Texas State Archives to this writer's attention. Return to Kennedy Assassination Home Page

Source of the Shots in the Kennedy Assassination C onspiracy books, videos and movies like Oliver Stone's "JFK" regale their audience by claiming "all those witnesses" who heard shots from the Grassy Knoll in Dealey Plaza. Sometimes the numbers quoted sound like hard information, but usually they can't stand up to scrutiny. 51 Witnesses? Let's start with something really silly. This article, by Harold Feldman claims that 51 witnesses heard shots from the Grassy Knoll. This claim was repeated in "JFK," mouthed by Kevin Costner (playing Jim Garrison) as he addressed the jury in the Clay Shaw conspiracy trial. Unfortunately, Feldman doesn't list the 51 supposed Grassy Knoll witnesses, and his assessment of the witnesses he does list is wildly at variance with their actual testimony in many cases. The article is from John Kelin's Fair Play web site . Josiah Thompson L ess silly, but still heavily inflated is the tabulation done by Josiah Thompson for his book Six Seconds in Dallas . Thompson admitted that a large number of witnesses heard shots coming from the Texas School Book Depository, but he claimed a larger number of witnesses who had heard shots from the Grassy Knoll. The pie chart at right shows that Thompson categorized 33 witnesses, or 51.6% of his sample, as hearing the shots coming from the Grassy Knoll. This number of Knoll witnesses is reasonably accurate (as we shall see) but Thompson radically undercounted Depository witnesses. The table below lists some representative errors that Thompson made: Some of Thompson's Classification Errors Witness Thompson Classification Correct Classification What Witness Said Bobby Hargis Knoll Uncertain "There wasn't any way in the world I could tell where they were coming from." 6H294-295 Nellie Connally Uncertain Depository Heard shots from the "right" and turned around to see JFK with arms to throat. 4H147-149. Told CBS that she heard shots from "behind us, over my right shoulder." Amos Lee Euins Uncertain Depository Reported seeing shooter in Depository, 2H201-210 Charles Hester Knoll Depository Shots "definitely came from in or around" the Texas School Book Depository. Decker Exhibit No. 5323 Hurchel Jacks Knoll Depository After turn on at Houston and Elm, shot came from "right rear" CE 1024 Marilyn Sitzman Uncertain Depository Told Deputy John Wiseman shots came from "Old Sexton Building" [Depository] Decker Exhibit No. 5323 Emmett Hudson Knoll Depository Said shots came from "the rear of the President's car and above it" 7H564 Mrs. R. A. Reid Uncertain Depository A Depository employee, she said shots had "come from our building." CE 2003, p. 54 Abraham Zapruder Knoll Uncertain Said he had no opinion of where the shots came from "by the sound" . . . "there was too much reverberation. There was an echo which gave me a sound all over" 7H572 House Select Committee The next important tabulation of earwitness testimony came from the House Select Committee on Assassinations. They found only 20 witnesses who actually believed they heard the shots from the vicinity of the Grassy Knoll, and 46 who thought the shots came from the direction of the Depository. See House Select Committee, Volume 2, p. 122. Their willingness to acknowledge the large number of witnesses who heard shots from the Depository was a huge improvement on Thompson's tabulation. But unfortunately, the House Select Committee undercounted Grassy Knoll witnesses. They apparently did this by demanding a high degree of precision from witnesses in order to count them in the category "Grassy Knoll." But unfortunately, witness testimony is often quite vague. Stewart Galanor A recent conspiracy-oriented tabulation comes from Stewart Galanor, author of Coverup . Galanor claims 52 Knoll witnesses, although he admits that there were 48 Depository witnesses (see right). Galanor has done students of the assassination an important service by putting selected testimony from the witnesses online. Galanor inflates the number of Knoll witnesses by a few dubious classifications, and by his decision to classify every witness who saw "smoke" in Dealey Plaza as a Knoll witness even if they didn't believe they heard any shots from the Knoll. Galanor believes that the "smoke" was evidence of a Grassy Knoll shooter, but in reality the witnesses mentioned "smoke" and "steam" and "motorcycle exhaust." The "smoke" could very easily have been exhaust from one of the police motorcycles in the motorcade, or even cigarette smoke from men behind the stockade fence (where cigarette butts were found). The simple fact is that modern firearms don't emit large clouds of smoke that hang in the air, as Oliver Stone discovered when he was filming the movie "JFK." Failing to find a rifle that emitted the needed cloud of smoke, he had a special effects man blow smoke from a bellows . Definitive Tabulation In an attempt to correct the deficiencies of earlier tabulations, I enlisted several students in my class on the Kennedy assassination to go through the testimony with a "fine tooth comb." I then reviewed the assessments the students had made, and changed a handful that I thought to be inaccurate. In 2013, a few witnesses who had not been identified nor included in any previous tabulation were added. The witnesses were identified by David Von Pein and John Reagor King on the newsgroup alt.assassination.jfk , and Kyle Whelton meticulously tracked down the primary sources on their testimony. The results are presented in the pie chart at right, and the detailed data can be found here . As can be seen, 33 witnesses believed that the shots came from the Grassy Knoll (or at least the direction of the Knoll), and 64 thought the shots came from the Depository (or at least, in that direction). Eight witnesses thought the shots came from a location entirely distinct from the Knoll and the Depository (including two who thought the shots came from inside the car!), and three witnesses thought they heard shots from two locations. Witnesses who didn't know, or couldn't distinguish between the Knoll and the Depository are excluded. This "two locations" number is exceedingly important. There is overwhelming evidence that at least some shots were fired from behind the motorcade. Several witnesses saw a shooter, or at least a gun in the sixth floor sniper's nest window. The medical evidence is clear that both Kennedy and Connally were hit from behind (regardless of whether either was also hit from the front). Once we understand that at least some shots came from behind, it is hard to see how shots could also have come from the Grassy Knoll without more witnesses reporting shots from more than one direction. It begins to look like some were confused about the direction of the shots. Some Witnesses Are Better Than Others Your browser does not support the video tag. Some of the best witnesses are those who were riding in the motorcade. Not only did they have clear lines of sight to both the Depository and the Grassy Knoll (making them less likely to be confused by echos), but many of them also showed a high degree of presence of mind in a traumatic situation. Key examples: John and Nellie Connally, who were riding with John and Jackie Kennedy in the presidential limo. In 1967, they gave their account of the source of the shots in an interview with CBS. All witnesses are fallible, but John and Nellie are two of the best. Does Any of This Matter? In reality, witness perceptions about the direction of shots have only limited value. One standard forensics text notes: It is extremely difficult to tell direction by sound of discharge of a firearm. . . . (Hatcher, Jury, and Weller, Firearms Investigations, and Evidence , First Edition, 1935, pp. 419-420) So even if the majority of witnesses did hear shots from the Depository, that's not particularly strong proof of anything. But: Conspiracists should not produce bogus numbers claiming that a clear majority of witnesses thought shots came from the Knoll. Conspiracists should not pretend that (even if their numbers were correct) it is strong proof of anything. How Many Shots? But how many shots did the witnesses hear? Overwhelmingly, only three. And of those who did not hear exactly three shots, more heard fewer than heard more than three shots. Remember, most conspiracy scenarios require six or eight shots. If the bullet that hit Kennedy in the back did not exit his throat, he must have been hit in the back and the throat by separate bullets. If a bullet exiting Kennedy's throat did not hit Connally, another bullet from behind must have hit him. Even conspiracy people (like Dr. Cyril Wecht) who have examined the evidence on Kennedy's head wound admit that he was hit in the head by at least one shot from behind. A head shot from the Grassy Knoll means two head shots. Most conspiracy people claim that Tague was hit by yet another bullet that missed the presidential limo entirely. Conspiracy people tout claims of numerous other "bullet strikes" in Dealey Plaza. Could the majority of the witnesses be wrong, and the shots have come from the Knoll? Of course. But conspiracy books, videos, and movies like "JFK" that imply that all or most of the Dealey Plaza witnesses thought the shots came from the Grassy Knoll are not being honest.

The LaFontaines' JFK Assassination Book Oswald Talked Did He Really Talk? Ray and Mary La Fontaine's Book C onspiracy buffs have, for a generation, believed that all those documents hidden away by the U.S. government contained the answer to the many mysteries surrounding the assassination. Who was Oswald? Who shot JFK? Who manipulated the shooter or shooters into position? Who in the government, exactly, ran the cover-up and exactly what did they do? When the documents are released, it will all become clear. Ray and Mary La Fontaine, authors of Oswald Talked , believe that this is exactly what has happened. They have, they think, unravelled the entire mystery. They claim in the preface to their book that: . . . the newly released records from the FBI, CIA, and U.S. Army began to tell the true story of Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassins of President Kennedy. It soon became clear that the Bureau of J. Edgar Hoover, far from investigating the assassination, had participated in a massive cover-up about Oswald. It also became clear why: conducting a real investigation would have disclosed the embarrassing fact that Oswald . . . had been recruited in March 1963 as an FBI informant (picking him up from the CIA, the likely agency that had earlier sent the ex-Marine . . . on a mission to Russia). It was in the role of FBI informant that Oswald visited New Orleans later that year, returned to Dallas in early October, and, on November 16, warned the Bureau of an impending assassination attempt . . . by a "Cuban faction." Explosive stuff, if true. But are the La Fontaines trailblasers using newly released documents to ferret out the long supressed truth? Or are they just two more conspiracy authors, relying heavily on unreliable sources while ignoring reliable ones, concocting far-fetched scenarios more out of speculation than evidence, and misleading readers by concealing information that goes contrary to their thesis? Several essays discuss and dissect the La Fontaine's use of evidence: One of the more interesting parts of the LaFontaines' new book concerns Silvia Odio. Where traditional conspiracy authors have taken her account at face value, the LaFontaines' have "upped the ante" with their new interpretation of the evidence. Researcher Steve Bochan takes issue with their logic and use of evidence in part one and part two of this critical essay, first posted on the newsgroup alt.conspiracy.jfk.moderated . Must reading if you have read Oswald Talked . David Reitzes likewise scrutinizes the La Fontaines' claim that Odio lied to cover up an extensive involvement of Oswald in anti-Castro Cuban activist circles . That the gun discovered on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository was a Mauser has been a staple of conspiracy books. The La Fontaines repeat this story, and add a twist. They believe two rifles were discovered in the Depository. In this short article , John McAdams examines their use of evidence. The La Fontaines believe there was something sinister about the fact that one of the backyard photos, called CE 133-C, was lost and was never looked at by the Warren Commission. This short article asks: "was it really?" Another staple of the conspiracy literature is the notion that Lee Oswald got gonorrhea (they say it was syphilis) "in the line of duty" and that this is evidence that Oswald was an intelligence agent. This theory was debunked long ago -- which doesn't prevent the La Fontaines from using it. One of the unmitigated, undeniable fiascos of the conspiracy theorists was their support for the claim that one Roscoe White was involved in the assassination . The La Fontaines, deeply involved in the White fiasco, continue to push the idea that White was involved in the assassination, and claim a "connection" between Oswald and White when both were in military service in the Pacific. See what strong statements they can make with virtually no evidence . A longer, first-hand account of the LaFontaines' involvement in the White fiasco and their continued attempt (in Oswald Talked ) to tie him to the assassination is found in David Perry's "Amateur Sleuth" article. The title comes from the LaFontaines' description of Perry and Gary Mack as "amateur sleuths." In fact, Perry is a long-time professional insurance investigator. Oswald claimed to Wes Frazier that he was taking "curtain rods" into the Texas School Book Depository on the day Kennedy was shot. But no curtain rods were ever found, and the Warren Commission concluded that the package actually contained the rifle that killed Kennedy. In Oswald Talked the LaFontaines claim "new evidence" in the form of some photos of curtain rods. Might these be the "curtain rods" that Oswald carried in to the Depository? The LaFontaines certainly want you to think so. What does the evidence show? The LaFontaines attempt to tie Oswald to the supposedly sinister David Ferrie and Clay Shaw by means of the "Clinton witnesses." Unfortunately, they badly mangled what the Clinton witnesses actually said . The LaFontaines have appeared on online JFK assassination newsgroups from time to time, and have been asked to defend various of the assertions in their book. They assert that Oswald returned from Mexico City "most likely by private transport and in the company of DRE members." They assert that "Oswald and [Guy] Bannister shared the same "space" [in] the sort of unpretentious cozy quarters where other tenants were likely to know something about your business." They use the testimony of one Delphine Roberts to establish a connection between Banister and Oswald. They claim that FBI agent James Hosty recruited Oswald to spy on anti-Castro Cubans. Needless to say, they failed to do so, and evaded all these questions. Hearsay Is Better -- The Single Bullet T he origin of CE 399, the single bullet, has long been controversal. Conspiracy theorists have long touted the testimony of Darrell Tomlinson, the man who found the bullet at Parkland Hospital, who believed it rolled off a stretcher not connected with the assassination. The Warren Commission concluded it rolled off Connally's stretcher. Relying on "new evidence" the La Fontaines propound a different theory: NEW EVIDENCE: Recently released tapes of the telephone conversations of President Lyndon Johnson show that he was told by FBI director J. Edgar Hoover within a week of the assassination that the bullet tagged as CE 399 was found on the president's stretcher, and was dislodged as emergency procedures were performed. It's one thing to belabor the testimony of Darrell Tomlinson, the fellow who found the bullet. Although witnesses are sometimes mistaken, Tomlinson was a witness. But the La Fontaines go with Hoover's statement. Hoover was not a witness. How he got the impression that the bullet was found on Kennedy's stretcher one can only guess -- probably it comes from early autopsy speculation. No witness supports this account. No political scientist, and no historian with any sophistication, will ever assume that information moves upward within an organization with stainless steel efficiency. What people at the top get is often incorrect -- and is essentially hearsay. Hoover's statement has essentially no evidentiary value. No serious treatment of the issue can pretend that it does. Twelve Steps to Conspiracy It's tempting to credit the La Fontaines with producing a new and novel conspiracy theory. But in conspiracy books, as in college logic courses, the conclusion can be no better than the premises. David Reitzes examines twelve key premises that underlie the La Fontaines' Oswald / anti-Castro Cuban / FBI / gunrunning / Jack Ruby scenario , and finds them to be based on tenuous assumptions, rather than solid evidence. The Elrod Story -- Did Oswald Spill the Beans to a Cellmate? The most striking claim in Oswald Talked revolves around a man named John Elrod. Elrod, according to the LaFontaines, claimed that he had been in the jail cell with Oswald on the day of Oswald's arrest. Supposedly, he and Oswald saw a prisoner with a battered face being marched down the corridor by guards. According to Elrod, Oswald remarked that he had been with the man in a motel room a few days before the assassination, discussing a transaction involving some stolen weapons. And Jack Ruby was in that motel room, according to Elrod. Needless to say, the story has some problems: Inherent Plausibility . Can we believe that Oswald would actually do that? . . . why would Oswald, who was smirky and elusive in everything he is known to have said after the assassination, who was smirky and elusive during his time in the Marines, in Russia, in Dallas, and in New Orleans, suddenly start talking cordially and intimately to a teenage car thief and a drunk? Surely, whether Oswald was part of a plot or not, he would have suspected that anyone put in a cell with him was there to inform on him to the authorities and thus would not have volunteered that he knew Ruby. (Gregory Curtis, "The Fourth Tramp" in The Texas Monthly , April 1996) Elrod's Credibility . Consider what Elrod told the FBI in 1964 , and compare it to the account recorded in Oswald Talked . Notice a "small detail" that's missing? Testimony . Researcher Gus Russo interviewed "literally dozens" of Dallas police officers, and all insisted that Oswald had no cellmate -- indeed, had the entire cellblock to himself. Russo reported this at the 1993 ASK Conference. Testimony . Page 74 of Chief of Police Jesse Curry's book, Assassination File , says: The suspect, Lee Harvey Oswald, was to be kept in a maximum security cell in F block on the fifth floor. All other prisoners were removed from adjacent cells, and a police guard was kept directly outside of the cell opposite the door. Chronology . Researcher Russ Burr, in an article that combines Warren Commission testimony and recent interviews , traces Oswald's whereabouts from his arrest until after midnight of the evening of the assassination. Do you see an opportunity here for Oswald to have talked to a roomate? Chronology. A document, discovered by Hazel Barrow, details Oswald's whereabouts and movements on the day of the assassination . Media Reports . In the hours following the assassination, the media reported that Oswald was being held in complete isolation. Here is a synopsis of reports on ABC and their affiliate WFAA-TV in Dallas . I n true conspiracy book fashion, the LaFontaines ignore the mass of evidence, and latch onto a dubious account that they can spin into an elaborate conspiracy scenario. Telling Tall Tales One element of the Elrod account, as recounted by the LaFontaines, was Elrod's claim to have been in line-ups with Lee Harvey Oswald "on a chain." Unfortunately for Elrod (and for the LaFontaines, who should have checked this out) records exist for all the line-ups that included Lee Oswald. Researcher Russ Burr obtained them from the Dallas Municipal Archives, and they don't show Elrod as having been in any of the line-ups . Oops! Wrong Armory. Researcher David Perry was one of the first to question the Elrod account of the LaFontaines. His essay "John Elrod, Does He Know Anything?" highlights several problems with his testimony and with the LaFontaines' elaborate theory of gun running -- including one fundamental slip that destroys their entire scenario. Click on image to see larger version Spooky Identification Card? At right is an identification card found on Lee Oswald's person when he was arrested. It's a DD1173 "Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card." It was issued to Oswald when he left active duty in the Marine Corps. The LaFontaines find it odd that Oswald would have had such a card, and claim that no other Marine in his unit had one like it. They then note that U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers had such a card, and that Powers was a contract employee of the CIA. They find these "facts" to be evidence that Oswald was in the employ of the CIA or some other intelligence agency. Researcher Douglas Horne of the Assassination Records Review Board studied this issue, and prepared a memo for members of the Board. The memo and supporting documentation is now online at Deanie Richards' JFK Place web site . Jean Davison obtained the document from the National Archives, and Judy Mickle converted it to electronic form. See how the LaFontaines' claims hold up to scrutiny. The La Fontaines are Garrisonites Ray and Mary La Fontaine don't give their forthright endorsement to the misbegotten "investigation" that District Attorney Jim Garrison conducted in New Orleans. But, as Dave Reitzes shows, they not only accept numerous factoids produced by Garrison, but offer them as "corroboration" for John Elrod's story, and they base much of their "follow the guns" scenario on them. And they attack Garrison's critics. A Spooky FBI Connection? Courtesy of Dave Reitzes, a case where the LaFontaines withheld information from their readers in an attempt to render something that Oswald said "suspicious:" The La Fontaines emphasize that Oswald was so "spooky" he was even aware of the term "Cosa Nostra," a term "not then widely known" ( Oswald Talked , 154). They write, "The term Cosa Nostra, allegedly used by Oswald in August 1963 (WC X 77), did not become widely known until Joseph Valachi's testimony in September of that year" ( Oswald Talked , 413 fn.). They quote Peter Dale Scott: "If Oswald was not being directed by the FBI, how did he [on August 5, 1963] come up to use a term current within the FBI and (because Valachi had made it up) current nowhere else?" ( Oswald Talked , 413 fn., quoting Peter Dale Scott, Deep Politics and the Death of JFK , 252) What the La Fontaines don't say is that Scott gives us a possible answer: Oswald could have read about it in that morning's New York Times or the current issue of the Saturday Evening Post (Scott, 252). Manipulating Marina When the Assassination Records Review Board tried to get ahold of Lee Harvey Oswald's tax records, they found that the IRS wound not release them without permission from Marina Oswald Porter, Lee's widow. They sought to get such permission, but discovered that the LaFontaines had persuaded Marina to sign a release that allowed the IRS to release the tax records to them . The LaFontaines promised to turn the documents over to the Archives, but failed to do so , apparently hoarding them until other researchers found that they had been in the public domain for years. Soft-Core Porn is Evidence? A mong the sources on which the LaFontaines rely heavily is a book titled Kennedy Ripples by Marianne Sullivan. Sullivan, supposedly, was a rival of Silvia Odio (a central character in their theory) for the affections of Father Walter Machann, a Catholic priest. The LaFontaines' Description Reading a few lines of Marianne Sullivan's Kennedy Ripples: A True Love Story , you know you've entered a new zone. The book, though published (in 1994) by a small San Clemente press, could glibly be called the Harlequin Romance version of the assassination. In reality, and despite some naive factual confusions, it is a refreshing contribution to the Kennedy literature that allows us a firsthand look at the preassassination world of Silvia Odio, Father Machann, and their Catholic circle of affluent Anglos and rabidly anti-Castro Cuban refugees. Oswald Talked , p. 263. How the Book Reads Crazy, insane, desire. Must be possessed completely by this man I love ... feel his fiery touch, the flames escaping burn and join, quickening, extinguished, then renewed, over and over. We lay alternately quiet the seethe, soaring in billows of clouds, as though above and beyond earth. A virgin in mind, until this night, when united in love our souls meet reaching depths unheralded. Take from me all humanity. Body gone. Spirit reigns. Devoured. Two in one flesh. Rise and sink, to rise again. To the summit, sustaining five glorious hours. For Michael? A virile heroic feat. A feat I hardly believe. Such virility. With each new surge of desire I wonder with awe! How has this man of the cloth ever lived alone? In a room all by himself? Kennedy Ripples , p. 100ff.

James Files / The Assassin From Blockbuster Video James Files Mug Shot from Stateville Prison (click on image to see larger version) The Assassin From Blockbuster Video The James Files "Confession" I t's not that unusual, really. Somebody "confesses" to to being involved in the assassination. David Perry's essay "Rashomon to the Extreme" lists all those who have come to the attention of assassination "researchers." Guys hanging around a bar with too many drinks under their belt spinning tall tales don't make Perry's list — although there must have been thousands. But what if the fellow doing the confessing is a talented con artist? And what if the story is promoted by a talented promoter? You're likely to see it at your local Blockbuster Video store ! Thus it is with James Files, a prisoner in Stateville Prison in Illinois — serving a sentence for shooting a policeman. His story has been promoted by the late Joe West, and more recently by Bob Vernon. But is Files really an assassin? Or is this another of the crackpot "confessions" in the mold of Chancey Holt, Robert Morrow , and others whose claims to have participated in the assassination have failed to stand up to scrutiny? Martin Shackleford is a conspiracy-oriented researcher with a reputation for not blindly accepting every new piece of "conspiracy evidence" that comes down the pike. His review of the video carefully scrutinizes Files story. The review is on Deanie Richard's JFK Place web site . John Stockwell is a long-time critic of the CIA, and an associate of Bob Vernon when he worked on the Files story. As such, he had an insider's view of the Files "confession" as it developed. The following series of messages, originally posted on the Internet, are a "tell all" memoir, and fascinating account of how the video came about, as well as a critical commentary on Files story. In Part 1 Stockwell give some background information on Joe West, Bob Vernon, and his own involvement in the project. Part 2 has further background information on Vernon, and how Joe West first came into contact with Files. Part 3 covers the death of Joe West, and how Bob Vernon took up the project. Part 4 discusses some of the ups and downs of the project over a 4 year span. Stockwell gives a detailed summary of Files published "confession" in Part 5 . Part 6 continues the summary of Files story, and begins a detailed critique. Part 7 is a further, detailed (virtually line by line and statement by statement) critique of Files story. In Part 8 , Stockwell completes his critique. A Story that "Improves" Over Time I n his critique of the Files "confession" (see above) Stockwell notes an interesting pattern in the development of the convict's story (quoting Stockwell): There seemed to be a pattern of misstatements by Files that were later corrected after I (and probably others) pointed out to West and Vernon solid factual errors. For example: Files initially said he and Oswald were "palling" around New Orleans with shipments of fake Thompson's submachine guns in 1961. Oswald was still in Minsk, that was a full year before he returned to the United States. Files originally said that Nicoletti used a Marlin 7.62 when he fired into Kennedy's head from the DalTex building. . . . I recalled that 7.62 would seemingly be a military weapon. And I did not recall Marlin ever producing a military weapon. So I called the Marlin factory. They confirmed that no such weapon had ever been made by them....but their 30.06 hunting rifle could be reconfigured, I believe they said to hold 5 rounds. I relayed this to Vernon and, a week or so later, sure enough, I was told, Files reported that he had reflected and remembered that Nicoletti used a Marlin 30.06 with a modified chamber.... Initially, Files was adamant that he was just a kid, a nobody, and that the CIA had nothing to do with the "hit" on Kennedy, although he said he had trained Cubans for the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, and that David Atlee Phillips was his "controller." As the story seemed to grow, he "palled" around with Oswald in Dallas during the week before the assassination. Phillips set up the contact. Over the years, as first West, then Vernon read more deeply into the assassination and related controversy, Files's alleged CIA legend grew dramatically. . . . Later, Files repeatedly hinted that he was more important in the CIA than the researchers might have realized. He said that he had been in direct contact with Dick Helms and with the "Joint Chiefs of Staff." He said he had hand-written notes from the Joint Chiefs of Staff (ordering hits and what-not.) And More than Just a Little Help Files' story has few defenders even among conspiracy-minded researchers. Finding holes and logical inconsistencies has been a favorite sport among assassination buffs. David Perry is a conspiracy-oriented, but critical-minded researcher. Here is his The Top Ten Reasons The Jim Files' Story Needs Help (with apologies to David Letterman, of course). Perry's web site, in fact, is a treasure trove of information on Files . Bogus Ballistics Do two spent cartridges found in Dealey Plaza proves Files story to be accurate? That's what his (very few) supporters say. But researcher Allan Eaglesham has found that the cartridges, supposedly left in the Plaza by Files in 1963, in fact could not have been manufactured before 1971 . Basically, Nobody Believes This Guy Deep Politics Quarterly is a well-established conspiracy-oriented JFK assassination journal. Edward Bell wrote their critique of Files story. You can read it from the Deep Politics web site by clicking here . Could a Con Con You? We would all like to think not. But Martin Shackleford, an assassination researcher who is a social worker by profession, has a different perspective. Such a con would be relatively easy, especially for a veteran like Files. For the past eighteen years, I have been working with delinquent teenagers, relatively much clumsier con artists than someone of Files' background. Even knowing that there's a good chance they might be trying to con me, I still fall for something from time to time, at least until I can check it out. Source: Newsgroup alt.conspiracy.jfk.moderated, post of 2/6/97 The Files Hustle Producer Bob Vernon has spent over a decade trying to arrange a "big score" from the James Files story, and the closest he's gotten was serious interest from NBC. But NBC was cautious, and refused to air the files story without checking it out. They hired author and assassination expert Edward J. Epstein to vet the story. The following is Epstein's account of what happened, from an April 24, 2001 e-mail written to Barb Junkkarinen (which Epstein gave Junkkarinen permission to post on the Internet): In brief, NBC retained me as a consultant for their planned story on Files. I hired the detective firm of Jules Kroll. JK established from telephone records Files was in Chicago, not Dallas, on November 22,1963. We then placed a call to Files from Dick Clark's office (DC was producer), and I interviewed Files about Kroll findings. He said he had a twin brother, who no one knew about, and whom he met shortly before November 22, and who he murdered after November 22. He said it was his twin brother in hospital with his wife, not him. His wife, however, said there was no twin, and Kroll confirmed there was no twin. My view then and now is that Files invented the story for the money it would earn him. Ed Epstein Epstein's account is corroborated by other sources. A story in the New York Post discusses this episode. NBC — like other networks — likes to take the high-minded stance that it doesn't pay for news and looks down on what it derisively refers to as "checkbook journalism." But the Peacock Network recently considered airing a special two-hour documentary about the assassination of President Kennedy, which would have put NBC in the position of paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for the story of a man who claimed to be an accomplice of Lee Harvey Oswald. . . . The only reason the documentary won't be airing during the cricial May sweeps rating period is that NBC wisely hired an outside consultant, writer Edward J. Epstein, who determined that the supposed Grassy Knoll Shooter was a fraud. . . . "NBC was talking to Dick Clark Productions. We did hire a consultant," NBC spokeswoman Pat Schultz said. "On his advice and that of others we decided not to go forward." . . . The scary thing is, it almost worked. While NBC was skeptical, Dick Clark and his producers were said to be gung-ho. As one source put it, "The amazing thing is how stupid they were." (Richard Johnson, "Peacock tempted to buy news," New York Post , May 9, 1994.

New Orleans/Garrison JFK Assassination Investigation NEW ORLEANS, AND THE GARRISON INVESTIGATION https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1991/05/19/on-the-set-dallas-in-wonderland/0c958035-3fc2-48a7-a108-da0855c92a94/ https://www.onthetrailofdelusion.com/post/did-delphine-roberts-see-oswald-in-banister-s-office I t was a three-ring circus. A flamboyant district attorney, with visions of conspiracy, proposing a series of theories, most of them bizarre. What he first called a "homosexual thrill killing" evolved, under the influence of the conspiracy buffs who flocked to New Orleans, into a massive CIA and federal government plot. When push came to shove in the courtroom, a jury took less than an hour to acquit Clay Shaw , the man Garrison put on trial. Overview Canadian Fred Litwin provides a thorough, cogent overview of the case , the "evidence" that fell apart under the slightest scrutiny, and the way it ruined the life of an honorable citizen of New Orleans. Fred Litwin’s recent book On the Trail of Delusion , documents the lunacy of the Garrison investigation, along with attempts to rehabilitate the New Orleans DA , with a plethora of heretofore unseen primary source documents. Many of these documents can be found online on Litwin’s blog. How Big a Conspiracy? Just how many people were involved in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy, and then to cover up their deed? Sound logic says that any conspiracy theory, to be credible, must include only a limited number of people . How many people did Garrison believe were involved? Nobody has an exact count, but the list of all the groups and individuals he implicated is pretty long. Sinister Connections? Conspiracy books routinely claim that Oswald had an office at 544 Camp Street in New Orleans, and that this was the "same address" occupied by Guy Banister's detective agency. This, supposedly, is evidence tying Oswald to Banister, Ferrie, and the anti-Castro Cubans. When the House Select Committee examined this issue in the late 70s , they found little solid evidence to place Oswald at that location. More recent research by Dave Reitzes shows that an office at 544 Camp Street was never more than a notion in the head of Lee Harvey Oswald. Lee Harvey Oswald was in the Civil Air Patrol as a youth in New Orleans. This raises the possibility that David Ferrie knew Oswald. Many conspiracy books imply that some sinister relationship between the two started at this time. The House Select Committee on Assassinations examined this issue, and this is their report. Does it suggest the possibility that Ferrie knew Oswald? Is there any evidence of a close relationship between the two? Conspiracy Witnesses One witness who, in the 1970s, placed Oswald in the office of Guy Banister Newman Building was Delphine Roberts , Banister's secretary. The House Select Committee didn't believe her testimony. Author Gerald Posner interviewed her in 1992 , and found her no more believable. In early 1967 she was extensively interviewed by Garrison's staff . She mentions all kinds of "suspicious" people, but not the most famous and most significant such person: Lee Harvey Oswald. Unlike Roberts, the Clinton witnesses have been believed by otherwise skeptical investigators like the House Select Committee and Norman Mailer. During and since the Clay Shaw trial, they have told a consistent and apparently sincere story of Lee Oswald, Clay Shaw, and David Ferrie visiting Clinton, Louisiana one day in 1963 in a big black car. But what if you look at the Clinton witnesses' early statements, before they were influenced by repeated questioning and repeated exposure to pictures of Oswald, Shaw, and Ferrie? Gerald Posner was the first researcher to gain access to very early accounts of the Clinton witnesses, and he outlines his findings in this passage from Case Closed . Posner's conclusion is: There is little doubt the Clinton witnesses are telling the truth as they now recall it. However, their original statements to Garrison's staff reveal considerable contradictions, so much so that the very heart of their story is invalidated . . . . It was almost six years after the alleged incident in Clinton that the witnesses first testified at the Garrison trial. Garrison's staff, when questioning the Clinton witnesses, had only presented photos of Oswald, Ferrie and Shaw, and incorrectly said that others had already identified those as the people who had visited the town. This power of suggestion, and later coaching, developed the testimony that today has been repeated so often that the House Select Committee found it so convincing. Dave Reitzes is in general agreement with Posner's thesis, but notes several factual errors that detract from Posner's presentation . One example of what Posner found in the documents is the development of the testimony of Corrie Collins. Compare his first statements to Andrew Sciambra (of Garrison's office) with his statements at the Shaw trial. Important findings on the Clinton episode appear in Patricia Lambert's book False Witness . Dave Reitzes, in this review , discusses the book. Finally, Dave Reitzes has written the definitive debunking of the Clinton episode . He shows how what started out as (in Garrison's words) "a whisper in the air" was developed into an impressively consistent facade of Shaw trial testimony. Was There a "Clay Bertrand?" Garrison's entire case was based on the belief that Clay Shaw, using the alias "Clay Bertrand" conspired to kill Kennedy. Where did the name "Clay Bertrand" come from? From an eccentric, rather sleazy New Orleans lawyer named Dean Andrews. Here is an account , abstracted from Kirkwood's American Grotesque , of Andrew's ever-changing testimony. It is often claimed that Clay Shaw admitted to using the "Clay Bertrand" alias when he signed a fingerprint card during his booking in New Orleans. The card, listing the alias, was produced by the Garrison prosecution. Did Shaw admit to the alias by signing the card? Examine an account of the prosecution's attempt to have the card entered into evidence in the Shaw trial (taken from American Grotesque ). Did Officer Habighorst tell the truth? Lou Ivon: No "Clay Bertrand" Like the FBI in 1963, Garrison's researchers combed the French Quarter for "Clay Bertrand," the man Dean Andrews said had called him on the day after the assassination and suggested that Andrews go to Dallas to legally represent Oswald. What was the result? The following memo was written by Garrison's chief investigator, Lou Ivon. M E M O R A N D U M February 25, 1967 TO: JIM GARRISON FROM: LOUIS IVON RE: CLAY BERTRAND To ascertain the location of one CLAY BERTRAND, I put out numerous inquiries and made contact with several sources in the French Quarter area. From the information we have obtained concerning this subject, I'm almost positive from my contacts that they would have known or heard of a CLAY BERTRAND. The information I received was negative results. On February 22, 1967, I was approached by "BUBBIE" PETTINGILL in the Fountainbleu Motor Hotel, located on Tulane Avenue, whom I had earlier contacted about CLAY BERTRAND. He stated that DEAN ANDREWS admitted to him that CLAY BERTRAND never existed. Ivon was not the only Garrison staffer to reach this conclusion. Assistant DA Andrew "Moo-Moo" Sciambra was given the task of "squeezing" the French Quarter to get information from homosexual informants. He admitted to author Edward Jay Epstein that he failed to find any "Bertrand." See Epstein's The Assassination Chronicles (New York, 1992), p. 196. Justice Assassinated: Garrison's Shoddy Case Against Shaw Dave Reitzes is an independent-minded researcher who has done a comprehensive survey of the evidence Garrison presented against Shaw. Here is his four-part essay: Meet Clay Bertrand . It all started with a shadowy (and possibly non-existent) figure named "Clay Bertrand" mentioned to the Warren Commission by Dean Andrews. Who was Clay Bertrand? Reitzes details attempts to discover the identity of this "mystery man" and to connect him with Clay Shaw. Assassin or Fall Guy? Garrison's attempt to link Shaw to an assassination conspiracy. A Question of Perjury. Garrison supporters, unable to show that Shaw conspired to kill Kennedy, often fall back to the claim that "he lied under oath." Is this true? Garrison's Witnesses Garrison had literally dozens of witnesses who would link Clay Shaw to Lee Oswald, or to the CIA, or to David Ferrie, or provide some sort of "sinister" linkage that Garrison thought important. Journalist James Phelan explained the process: In the two years between the Shaw hearing and the trial, Garrison's staff interviewed hundreds of would-be witnesses. There are certain sensational cases that have a fascination for unstable people and fetch them forth in droves. A classic example was the "Black Dahlia" mutilation murder of playgirl Elizabeth Short in Los Angeles. Over the years, dozens of people came forward and confessed to this crime, which still remains unsolved. Celebrated cases also attract witnesses who are not psychotic, but who falsely identify key figures out of faulty memory or a desire to lift themselves out of dull anonymity into the spotlight. Chief Justice Frankfurter once commented that eyewitness testimony is the greatest single cause of miscarried justice. In a sensational case, a careful prosecutor often spends more time winnowing out false witnesses than he does working with authentic ones. The Garrison investigation had a disastrously low threshold, across which trooped a bizarre parade of people eager to bolster his conspiracy scenario. ( Scandals, Scamps, and Scoundrels , p. 169) Not surprisingly, only a tiny handful of Garrison's witnesses had enough credibility to take the stand at the Shaw trial, and most of these were discredited by the defense. Phelan goes on to discuss a few typical ones . Other, more important ones included: Charles Spiesel Spiesel testified to having seen Clay Shaw and David Ferrie plotting to kill JFK. He was an impressive witness — until the defense started asking him questions . Jules Ricco Kimble He wasn't put on the witness stand in the Shaw trial, but that doesn't stop Garrison from repeating his stories in the book On the Trail of the Assassins . But as Dave Reitzes shows, his credibility could hardly be more suspect . Jack Martin Another witness who placed Oswald at 544 Camp and told numerous "interesting" stories was Jack Martin . Out-of-town conspiracy writers were happy to accept Martin's statements at face value, as was Oliver Stone. But local people were more careful: A States-Item reporter, who has spent more time than most listening to Jack Martin talk, describes him "as one of the most interesting men I ever have met." "He is as full of that well known waste material as a yule hen. On the other hand, he is many times a very competent investigator who has the friendship and confidence of reputable, well-placed individuals. He drinks, often to excess, but bears no real evidence of being an alcoholic. He desperately wants to be loved, and this is his downfall. Often, he wants to please everyone, everywhere so damn much that he ends by hurting the people who have befriended him. He must be taken with a grain of salt leavened by a grain of confidence. If you listen to him for two hours, often you will receive two minutes of useful information. I suppose, to sum him up, he is like a muddy river. You have to use a very fine filter." Rosemary James & Jack Wardlaw, Plot or Politics? , p. 48. Jack Martin was well-known in New Orleans, and uniformly regarded as unreliable. Not surprisingly, Garrison never put Martin on the stand. Richard Case Nagell Like Martin, Richard Case Nagell was a witness who gave considerable "information" to the Garrison investigation, but never testified. But this doesn't stop Garrison from using Nagell's stories about CIA and KGB foreknowledge of an assassination plot in On the Trail of the Assassins , and saying that "Nagell impressed me as being utterly honest and sincere" and that "I was satisified that a fabricated tale was not in this man's makeup" ( On the Trail of the Assassins , pp. 185,186). Read Dave Reitzes' account of Nagell's ever-changing story , and decide whether Nagell was capable of fabrication. Perry Raymond Russo Jim Garrison's key witness in his case against Clay Shaw was a certain Perry Raymond Russo (pictured at left). During the Shaw trial, Russo told a story of an "assassination party" in which Shaw, David Ferry, and Lee Oswald discussed killing Kennedy. Yet Russo's testimony underwent an interesting "evolution" between the time he first came forward in Baton Rouge and his court testimony. He was repeatedly questioned, repeatedly shown pictures of Clay Shaw, and then given "truth serum" and put under hypnosis at least twice. Russo was, according to Dave Reitzes, the "Way Too Willing Witness," who proved extremely pliable in the hands of Garrison and his staff. Was Clay Shaw a Spook? Jim Garrison charged that Clay Shaw was a CIA agent, and Garrison supporters have accepted this view. But secret documents released by the Agency show something entirely different , as does the testimony of former CIA insider Victor Marchetti. Crackpot Shooting Scenario And how many shooters and co-conspirators were in Dealey Plaza, according to Garrison? In this excerpt from a Playboy interview , he lists the sinister cast of characters he believes were in Dealey Plaza that day. Another thing that supposedly linked Clay Shaw to sinister forces was his membership on the Board of Directors of an Italian operation called "Permindex." Conspiracy books all claim that that Permindex was a CIA front. They fail to tell the full story, however, as to where this "information" comes from. The reality was exposed in a classic article in the British journal Lobster . A more recent, and definitive, treatment of this issue by journalist Max Holland appeared in the journal Studies in Intelligence . Garrison the Man Jim Garrison had a skill that has been seldom noted. He was a cryptographer! This passage, from Epstein's Counterplot , shows how he applied his cryptographic abilities to the prosecution of Shaw. It's hilarious, if you can forget that Clay Shaw's life was ruined by this sort of "logic." Other examples of Garrison's bizarre behavior include: His phone call to Warren Hinckle , editor of Ramparts magazine, fingering the aerospace industry as the culprits. His conversation with James Kirkwood , in which he explained a "sinister" connection between the International Trade Mart and the Cordell Hull Foundation. A conversation with journalist Hugh Aynesworth, where Garrison explains that his family is in danger from Miami-based assassins . But not until noon. His explanation to journalist James Phelan that the assassination was a homosexual thrill killing. Garrison thought some conspirator had inserted a bullet with a "magnum load" into his pistol. Clinical Psychopathology? In 1952, Jim Garrison was relieved of duty in the National Guard. Doctors at the Brooke Army Hospital in Texas diagnosed him as suffering from a "severe and disabling psychoneurosis" which "interfered with his social and professional adjustment to a marked degree." The evaluation further said that Garrison "is considered totally incapacitated from the standpoint of military duty and moderately incapacitated in civilian adaptability," and recommended long-term psychotherapy. See Case Closed , p. 423. In 1986, Patricia Toole interviewed Garrison, and asked him about various authors who had written books on the Kennedy assassination. See what he says about Tony Summers' Conspiracy and Henry Hurt's Reasonable Doubt . This interview is from the files of the AARC in Washington, DC. Crackpot Prosecutions Garrison was always indicting people based on the flimsiest evidence, or the wildest notions of how they might be guilty of something. The most famous of his crackpot prosecutions, of course, was that of Clay Shaw. But there were others. David Lifton is a conspiracy-oriented researcher who, at the time of Garrison's investigation, knew one Kerry Thornley, who had been a Marine buddy of Lee Oswald's. Lifton thought Thornley might be of help to the investigation, and brought Thornley to Garrison's attention. But then, to Lifton's horror, Garrison concluded that Thornley was actually a coconspirator and Oswald "look-alike ." Garrison got a letter claiming that one Edgar Eugene Bradley had made inflammatory comments about John Kennedy. Following up, Garrison found that Bradley had been in El Paso, Texas on the day of the assassination. Based on this "evidence," he issued an murder warrant for Bradley, who was living in California. When Garrison's staff failed to produce evidence and witnesses at an extradition hearing, California governor Ronald Reagan refused to extradite Bradley. In this interview, Bradley recounts his experiences . War Among the Buffs The ranks of conspiracy believers have long been split by different attitudes toward Garrison. Many important conspiracy authors (Tony Summers, Henry Hurt, David Lifton) believe Garrison to have been reckless and irresponsible. Yet Garrison has a vocal cadre of supporters among conspiracy buffs. An e-mail feud took place in August 1995 between David Lifton, who had seen Garrison's antics first-hand , and Garrison supporters Gary Aguilar and Lisa Pease. Lifton's view of Garrison: I think its ugly when the power of the state is arrayed against an innocent man — and the witchhunt that took place in New Orleans back in 1967-69 will always remain exactly that: an ugly incident in the annals of jurisprudence . . . In spite of the current popularity of Garrison in conspiracy circles, most mainstream conspiracist authors have blasted Garrison and his New Orleans "investigation." "H e went from a highly intelligent eccentric to a lunatic in the period of one year. . . . Every time press interest in the case would start to wane, he would propound a new theory. One week it would be 14 Cubans shooting from storm drains. The next week it would be H. L. Hunt and the far right in Dallas. This was no Robin Hood — no Untouchable either." Rosemary James in Newsweek , 12/23/91. Garrison's Defenders To see how pro-Garrison conspiracy buffs treat the investigation, check out: Lisa Pease's Real History web site . Dave Reitzes' review of Bill Davy's book Let Justice Be Done . Davy is a pro-Garrison writer who defends the conduct of the District Attorney. Dave Reitzes' review of an article by Martin Shackelford about "Garrison's case" in the ironically titled e-zine Fair Play . Ray and Mary La Fontaine are not forthright Garrison supporters, but they accept numerous factoids from his "investigation," use these factoids as "corroboration" for their theories, and attack his critics . Joe Biles is a moderate Garrisonite whose former web site has some interesting materials. Joan Mellen's book A Farewell to Justice is the latest to defend Garrison. But Mellen has fallen into the trap of believing the most incredible sources and adopting the most outlandish theories in an attempt to vindicate the DA, as Patricia Lambert shows in this review of the book . In another essay, Dave Reitzes discusses Garrison's central, critical witness, Perry Raymond Russo. Mellen accepts his testimony, which Reitzes shows was vastly unreliable . Lambert shows how Mellen blew off the testimony of a key reliable witness , one Dr. Frank Silva, when it conflicted with the Garrison version of events. Mellen repeats many of the charges against various individuals that have been going around in Garrisonite circles for years. One target of the Garrisonites has been Canadian Louis M. Bloomfield, supposed kingpin in a sinister right-wing network that had Kennedy killed. Paul Mitchinson debunks this in a posting on his blog , and reveals much about the ideological agenda behind the attack. Mellen's book has been scrutinized by other JFK researchers and come up short. Mel Ayton, and an extended and detailed review concludes that “Mellen’s book has the façade of scholarship but it is in fact a hocus pocus act.” Did Garrison Spy on Journalistic Critics? The following is from a typewritten document in the Assassination Archives and Research Center in Washington, DC. It is dated August 26, 1967, and has the handwritten notation (presumably by AARC personnel) "Bud Finsterwald's notes." Notes on interview with Jim Garrison, District Attorney, New Orleans — 1:00 to 4:00 P.M. at Criminal Courts Building, New Orleans. Also present part time: Louis IVON, Garrison's Chief Investigator. Garrison was extremely interested in our wiretap investigation. Feels strict legislation is very necessary. Says he only uses it against "guys like Sheridan." Feels his office and home phones are tapped by the Bureau but doesn't care. Walter Sheridan, of course, was one of the journalists who took a critical stance toward Garrison and his "investigation." The notes also say "Sheridan — No good Bastard — Compared him with Nazis." Insiders Go Public When Perry Raymond Russo took the stand during the preliminary hearing at the Shaw trial, he told a story radically different from the one he told Sciambra in Baton Rouge (see above). Journalist James Phelan confronted Garrison with the discrepancy, and a meeting at Garrison's house followed. This passage, from American Grotesque , describes that meeting — which resulted in investigator William Gurvich defecting from the Garrison team. When he wrote On the Trail of the Assassins Garrison denigrated Gurvich, and claimed he had only a marginal role in the investigation. In reality, Gurvich was an important figure at the center of the probe . The House Select Committee on Assassinations interviewed Gurvich in 1978. Gurvich gives a fascinating insider's account of Garrison the man and the Garrison investigation. James Phelan himself started out as an "insider" — a friend of Garrison's on the basis of a very favorable article he had written about the DA in the Saturday Evening Post . But when Garrison carelessly gave Phelan documents that blew the case against Shaw entirely out of the water, Phelan concluded that Garrison's case was fraudulent, as he explained in an article in the Saturday Evening Post . Edward Jay Epstein was trained as a Political Scientist, but early on moved to journalism with a critique of the Warren Commission titled Inquest . When Garrison's investigation became public he, like many buffs, went to work for Garrison as a volunteer. In the wake of Garrison's death in 1992 he described his experiences in "Epitaph For Jim Garrison: Romancing the Assassination" in the New Yorker . Tom Bethell was an Englishman who was in New Orleans to write a book on Dixieland Jazz. When the Garrison investigation broke, he got caught up in the enterprise. Working as a staffer for Garrison, he gained an unique perspective on Garrison, the evidence, other Garrison staff members, conspiracy buffs, and reporters covering the trial. Here is his diary, obtained from the National Archives. 6/25/67-9/13/67 9/14/67-10/2/67 10/3/67-10/26/67 11/3/67-1/28/68 1/31/68-2/12/68 2/13/68-2/21/68 2/22/68-3/13/68 3/14/68-3/15/68 3/16/68-4/1-7/68 In the 1970s, Bethell wrote an article for the Washington Monthly that summarized his experiences with the Garrison investigation and offered some cogent comments on the intellectual habits of the conspiracy "researchers." Can you Trust Garrison on Garrison? Garrison's book On the Trail of the Assassins was the basis of the movie JFK . The book is a fanciful historical narrative that bears only a tenuous relationship with reality. Here is a list of the discrete, provable lies in the book . Garrison's key witness implicating Shaw in a conspiracy to murder Kennedy was Perry Raymond Russo, but Russo's testimony was elicited during "truth serum" and hypnosis sessions. When Garrison turned over the transcripts of the hypnosis sessions to the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1977, he doctored them to conceal the fact that Russo told about Shaw conspiring only in response to a highly leading question . Really Mysterious? Another "mysterious" death was that of David Ferrie (left). Did he commit suicide to avoid being prosecuted for Kennedy's murder by DA Garrison? Was he killed by minions of The Conspiracy? In this article , Dr. Robert Artwohl discusses Jim Garrison's contention that Ferrie died of an overdose of Proloid, a thyroid medication, and Garrison's apparent mishandling of evidence. Ferrie left two supposed "suicide notes," however on close inspection it's not at all clear they are in fact suicide notes. Did Oswald Have Ferrie's Library Card? It's supposed to be a "link" between Ferrie and Oswald: the story that Oswald had Ferrie's library card in his possession when he was arrested. Dave Blackburst, in a message posted on the moderated Internet newsgroup , explains where this factoid came from . Primary Sources on Garrison R eal historical research is done from "primary sources" — the original documents, transcripts, testimony and so on that are the earliest and closest reflection of the historical event. People who want to study the Garrison investigation are immensely lucky that researcher Dave Reitzes has an ongoing interest in — indeed, almost an obsession with — the topic. His "Perpetual Pages" web site has an impressive collection of primary sources on Garrison , as well as the trial transcript of the Clay Shaw trial in New Orleans . And Fred Litwin has assembled a massive collection of sources on Garrison in writing his book On the Trail of Delusion , which documents the lunacy of the Garrison investigation with a plethora of heretofore unseen primary source documents. Many of these documents can be found online on Litwin’s blog. A CIA Campaign Against Garrison? Garrison supporters have followed the lead of Garrison himself in claiming that there was a CIA campaign to spy on him, attack him in the press, and disrupt his investigation by feeding it disinformation. Such claims are extremely convenient for the Garrisonites. Faced with staffers who left the probe and claimed it was bogus, they simply assert that the defectors were government agents anyway. Faced with hostile press accounts, they explain that those were produced by CIA "assets." Faced with wild investigative antics by Garrison, they explain that those were the result of disinformation fed to Garrison by agents. If such a campaign existed, the internal CIA documents describing it should make fascinating reading. And indeed, author Max Holland has discovered several key documents outlining the CIA's reaction to the Garrison probe. The Agency's response to Garrison , however, is rather different from the one claimed by the conspiracists. "Bill Boxley" One of the supposed infiltrators Garrison singled out in On the Trail of the Assassins was "Bill Boxley," supposedly from the CIA. Internal CIA documents show "Boxley's" actual relationship with the Agency . Gordon Novel Conspiracy books will flatly state that Gordon Novel, an "electronics expert" hired by Garrison to provide anti-eavesdropping services, was a "CIA employee." In reality, Novel had no connection with the Agency, as shown by a secret FBI memo . Novel in fact was a hustler and con artist who already had an arrest record when he showed up in New Orleans to work for Garrison. Numerous internal secret CIA documents show he had no connection with the Agency . How Many Spooks? Garrison was convinced that New Orleans was crawling with CIA agents, who had not only plotted to murder Kennedy, but also to oppose his investigation. With the release of assassination-related records in the 1990s, the CIA's own internal documents have become public, and they detail who had what connections with the Agency. A key one, with the subject heading "Garrison Investigation: Queries from Justice Department," shows that very few of the people Garrison claimed were spooks actually were. Do You Really Want the Records Open? Opening up the historical record has been a long-running crusade of conspiracy people. Sometimes, the record reveals things that some buffs would prefer hidden. When author Gerald Posner got access to the documents in the possession of the New Orleans District Attorney's office, he found some hair-raising things. But not about the CIA or the FBI. Read his article here , and them check out his web page for more information about him and his projects. Garrison and the Mafia A lthough Garrison was willing to include the CIA, the FBI, the Federal government, and just about everybody else you can imagine in his assassination conspiracy, one group was conspicuously missing: the Mafia. Garrison's good relations with various Mafia figures might have something to do with this. When the House Select Committee on Assassinations quizzed Garrison on the possibility of a Mafia connection, and particularly about New Orleans Mafia chieftan Carlos Marcello , Garrison replied as follows: When asked if he believed Marcello was a man capable of having President Kennedy murdered, Garrison did not directly answer the question. Garrison stated that he has "certainly heard" that Marcello may have once been involved in some kind of criminal activity years ago. He stated that he has some reason to believe that some of Marcello's money was obtained through criminal acts many years ago. Garrison further stated that he has heard of allegations linking Marcello to organized crime and the Mafia, but does not know if they are true. He stated that he has heard over the years that Marcello may be a man of significant wealth, and may in fact be one of Louisiana's wealthier citizens. He stated that Marcello is not active in real estate and is a businessman. When asked again if he believes that Marcello had the motive and means to assassinate President Kennedy, Garrison again did not respond to the question, and began talking about another subject at length. You may wish to read the entire interview . In his book On the Trail of the Assassins , Garrison is no more forthcoming. The periodic allegations that I am on friendly terms with organized crime figures are amusing, in light of my record . . . . It has been my policy not to respond to each of the many canards which have been part of the campaign to discredit my investigation, nor to waste time trying to prove negatives. For what it is worth, however, I do not even know Carlos Marcello, the man with whom I am frequently linked by my detractors. Nor, for that matter, did I ever in my years as district attorney come upon any evidence that he was the Mafia kingpin the Justice Department says he is. (p. 288) So it seems the District Attorney who claimed to have solved the crime of the century was unable to discover that top New Orleans mob boss Marcello was part of the Mafia!

The Attempt to Rehabilitate Jim Garrison The Attempt to Rehabilitate Jim Garrison Some Authors Continue to Support His Sham Investigation of Clay Shaw By Fred Litwin Since the release of JFK , three authors have tried to rehabilitate Jim Garrison and his nonexistent case against Clay Shaw. In 1999, William Davy published Let Justice Be Done: New Light on the Jim Garrison Investigation ; Joan Mellen released A Farewell to Justice: Jim Garrison, JFK's Assassination, and the Case That Should Have Changed History in 2005 and 2013; and James DiEugenio came out with Destiny Betrayed: JFK, Cuba and the Garrison Case in 1992 and 2012. Editor’s Note: This essay is from Fred Litwin’s book On the Trail of Delusion , which documents the lunacy of the Garrison investigation with a plethora of heretofore unseen primary source documents. Many of these documents can be found online on Litwin’s blog. They all suffer from invincible ignorance and peddle ridiculous conspiracy theories. They all believe that federal agencies interfered with Garrison’s investigation and that Garrison was betrayed from within by a coterie of spies and agents. And they all propagate the nonsense that Kennedy had to be killed because he was going to end the Cold War, withdraw from Vietnam, and usher in a new era of peace and prosperity. None of this was true. Of the three, Mellen is the most credulous, believing every Garrison “witness” and buying into every Garrison theory. The centerpiece of her book is Thomas Beckham (see Chapters 16 and 17), and she even includes a picture of Beckham in his rabbi’s gown. Well, the con man fooled Garrison, and so it’s no surprise that he fooled Mellen. Fred Crisman is in her book, as is Slidin’ Clyde Johnson, and even the second Oswald makes an appearance. She regurgitates so many stories of so many conspirators that she can’t cobble together any sort of coherent narrative. Patricia Lambert notes that “ A Farewell to Justice is not an easy read. The book’s epic-size cast sometimes renders the narrative incoherent. New characters appear at a dizzying rate, vast numbers of whom are said to be CIA connected—CIA operatives, CIA media assets, CIA agents, CIA employees. Affixing the CIA label to as many lapels as possible (regardless of how flimsy the evidence), appears to be a central goal of this book, the assumption being that no such association could possibly be innocent or, God forbid, patriotically inspired.” Unreliable Witnesses The three books are quite incestuous and include many of the same stories, sometimes with absolutely no documentation. Take the story of Slidin’ Clyde Johnson as told in Chapter 13. DiEugenio claims that “he was brutally beaten on the eve of the trial and hospitalized.” He references Davy (page 310) and Mellen (page 301). Mellen writes that “on the day before he was scheduled to testify, Clyde Johnson was beaten up so badly he had to be hospitalized.” Her only reference is to the Times-Picayune in July 24, 1969. But they report that a few days before Shaw went on trial, Johnson held a press conference in New Orleans and said, “I’m the ace-in-the-hole in Garrison’s case.” One day later he was arrested by police for refusing to pay his bill at the Roosevelt Hotel. The Davy book says that “In February of 1969, he was severely beaten and never testified.” He offers no footnote. It takes chutzpah to argue that Clay Shaw was involved in the JFK assassination, but all three books take a shot. This means they thus have to prove that Shaw was Clay Bertrand (see Chapter 3). Unfortunately, they all prefer quantity over quality; they present many witnesses to support their case, but none that have any credibility. DiEugenio and Mellen claim that Dean Andrews privately admitted to Warren Commission critic Harold Weisberg that Shaw was Bertrand. Remember, Andrews was always adamant that Shaw was not Bertrand (see Chapter 3). In May 2001, Joan Mellen wrote to Weisberg and asked him if he remembered the details of his conversation with Andrews. He replied: “Andrews told me that Shaw was Bertrand without putting it that way. We were in his office discussing some of the evidence, what I now do not recall, when Andrews said, approximately these words, “If the Green Giant gets past that, he is home clear.” Now, Dean Andrews might have been a hip, jive-talkin’ attorney, to be sure, but it seems to me that Weisberg read just a little too much into his words. Joan Mellen Another DiEugenio witness is Leander D’avy, whose interview with Garrison’s staffers he found to be “utterly fascinating.” He worked at a restaurant and bar, The Court of the Two Sisters, and claimed that Oswald walked in one night and asked for Clay Bertrand and that Clay Shaw frequented the place. In 1977, D’avy was deposed by the HSCA, and he recalled that about two weeks before the assassination, he had gone in on a Saturday morning to pick up his check. He was sent to the storeroom, which he said was actually a little apartment, and guess who was there? Lee Harvey Oswald was lying across the bed. David Ferrie was there, and yes, the three tramps were there as well. He saw other people too. Jack Ruby once parked in a loading zone in front of the restaurant and slapped D’avy in the face when he complained. Fred Crisman came around “almost every week” in 1963. Even Thomas Beckham was in the restaurant. It’s not surprising that HSCA investigators thought there were “serious questions about his credibility.” Then there is William Morris who “signed an affidavit he knew Shaw as Clay Bertrand.” Morris was interviewed in 1967 while an inmate at the Wynne State Prison Farm in Texas. He claimed that Shaw worked for General Electric and that he lived with his mother, which were both untrue. Morris was six feet tall but said he was taller than Bertrand, forgetting that Shaw was quite tall at 6’4”. Further, he claimed that Bertrand brought had Jack Ruby to his apartment. Is there any wonder why he didn’t testify at the Shaw trial? DiEugenio claims that Clay Shaw’s maid Virginia Johnson said that “a man who stayed with Shaw on several occasions told her that Shaw had used the name of Bertrand.” However, Johnson’s statement says something quite different: yes, she had heard the name Bertrand, but she wasn’t quite sure of the details. Lots of people were talking to her; she had conversations at a fabric class about the case, but “When asked if Mr. Formadol [ sic ] [she was clearly talking about Shaw’s friend William Formyduval] referred to Mr. Shaw as Bertrand, she stated no.” Garrison’s investigators went back several months later for another interview, and this time she said that “she had never heard the name, Bertrand.” Then there is Mrs. Jessie Parker, who testified that she had seen Shaw at the Eastern Airlines VIP Room at Moisant Airport and that he had signed the guest book as Clay Bertrand. But DiEugenio neglects to tell his readers that Shaw was supposedly with a group of visitors from Venezuela who were accompanied by U.S. State Department employees and a military escort. The military man did not recognize a photo of Shaw as the man in the VIP room. One of the State Department employees did recognize Shaw’s picture but only because he knew Shaw professionally, and he said Shaw was not at the airport. [1] Yet another DiEugenio witness is Thomas Breitner, who “said that, on Shaw’s trip to San Francisco, he visited the University of California and he introduced himself as Bertram.” You can see Turner’s report below—you have to love the last paragraph. Breitner could only have gotten the name Clem from the media since Perry Russo was the only person to use that name for Clay Bertrand. Breitner called the Berkeley Police Department in April 1965 insisting that his wife had attempted to kill him by means of putting “a poisonous powder” in his soup. He made a series of phone calls in February 1968 to the FBI claiming that his life had been threatened by people who were manufacturing miniature darts treated with poison. He wrote another letter in 1969 about CIA harassment. Of course, Garrison did not dare put Breitner on the witness stand. As for Perry Russo, Garrison’s chief witness against Clay Shaw, DiEugenio completely ignores damaging material. When Russo was first questioned in Baton Rouge, he didn’t say a word about Shaw being part of a conspiracy and said he had only briefly met Shaw twice. All that changed when he was brought to New Orleans, administered sodium pentothal, then hypnotized during three sessions. DiEugenio leaves all this out, making it appear that Russo had told one consistent story from the beginning. James Phelan wrote to DiEugenio’s publisher and said that “this requires him to censor extensive passages of the trial record and eliminate the cause of Garrison’s court disaster.” Quotes Out of Context Since they can’t prove that Shaw was Bertrand, well, these authors just make incriminating stuff up. For instance, DiEugenio makes a big deal out of an entry in Clay Shaw’s notebook. “Although the entire book listed addresses and phone numbers, on one otherwise blank page were scrawled two abbreviations ‘Oct.’ and ‘Nov.’ and next to those, the word ‘Dallas.’” This claim was taken, almost word-for-word, from Garrison’s book. The actual page from Shaw’s notebook is shown below, and it’s not quite as advertised. Is there something nefarious that I am missing? Of course, taking all context out of documents is a DiEugenio specialty. In the summer of 1977, as indicated in Chapter 17, Garrison met with investigators from the HSCA for about a week. Jonathan Blackmer, the lead attorney looking into New Orleans, reported on this in a lengthy memo in which he listed Garrison’s main suspects. They were at the front end investigating Garrison’s leads, and you can see that when he wrote that “Garrison is putting together a file on Clay Shaw which he will forward to the Select Committee upon completion.” Garrison’s files on David Ferrie were being indexed by Patricia Orr, an HSCA staffer. The section on Clay Shaw says that “Garrison believes Shaw was part of a conspiracy whose ultimate goal was the assassination of JFK.” Blackmer is just repeating what Garrison told him, and then he writes: “We have reason to believe that Shaw was heavily involved in the anti-Castro efforts in New Orleans in the 1960’s and possibly one of the high-level planners or “cut out” to the planners of the assassination.” The section concludes that “further information about Shaw will be developed as we receive it from Garrison” and that “we are still developing a partial witness list for Shaw.” DiEugenio quotes the statement above about Shaw being a planner and, by removing all context, makes it look like an HSCA conclusion as opposed to a Garrison belief. Needless to say, the HSCA Final Report didn’t mention any of this. Investigation “Penetrated?” Of course, the real reason Garrison lost his case against Shaw was not his lack of evidence. No, DiEugenio believes there was a “three-stage program to destruct Garrison’s case and to be make sure Shaw would be acquitted.” The first stage consisted of “singleton” penetrations of his office to disrupt from within. William Gurvich was Garrison’s chief investigator who quit in disgust in June 1967. But really, it is claimed, he was CIA. The evidence? Well, his father was an FBI agent, but here’s the kicker: Gurvich’s niece told a JFK critic whom she had met on holiday that “he did some work for the CIA.” Gordon Novel, the scam artist who tricked Garrison into hiring him as his electronic security chief, was an “experienced CIA operative” who “became a good target for Allen Dulles to hire to infiltrate Garrison’s office.” [2] Nice story, just no evidence. DiEugenio tries to make the case that Novel’s lawyers were paid by the CIA. But the papers of Elmer Gertz, Novel’s lawyer in his libel case against Playboy magazine and Jim Garrison, contain hundreds of letters demanding payment from Novel and threatening to end the case. Jim DiEugenio The second stage was the use of “intelligence assets/journalists” like James Phelan, Hugh Aynesworth, and Walter Sheridan to wreck Garrison. Sheridan produced the NBC documentary on the Garrison investigation (see Chapter 7). DiEugenio believes that the CIA funneled money to him to defer production costs and that a “covert team was assembled” around Sheridan. But Sheridan was a long-time “trusted Kennedy family operative, loyalist, and staffer for three decades.” When he died, Edward Kennedy said he was “an extraordinary investigator and an extraordinary human being. His courage and dedication to justice and the public interest were unmatched by anyone.” Incredibly, DiEugenio believes that a long-time friend of the Kennedy family would let JFK’s murderers go free. James Phelan was the journalist Garrison confided in in Las Vegas. He realized that Perry Russo’s initial statements in Baton Rouge did not contain the conspiracy story he had spun in New Orleans. But had Phelan wanted to harm Garrison, he could have gone straight to Shaw’s attorneys with this information. Instead, he went back to Garrison to confront him with the inconsistent stories. To DiEugenio, Phelan was “on a mission” and was an “intelligence asset.” Another nice story and, again, no evidence. Hugh Aynesworth is one of the finest journalists of our time. He covered every angle of the JFK assassination, from Dealey Plaza to Jack Ruby’s trial, and he was also an early confidante of Jim Garrison’s. His big crime was helping Shaw’s attorneys, and naturally DiEugenio believes Aynesworth was CIA. His proof? Aynesworth tried to get into Cuba in 1962 and told the contact division of the CIA he would provide information (the CIA memo is below). Harold Weisberg wrote to Joan Mellen in April 2000 and said, “The CIA did not have to penetrate Garrison. He provided his own endless insanities.” In another letter to her, he wrote, “Nobody had to do a thing to him. He did more than enough to himself.” David Reitzes, one of the best researchers of the Garrison fiasco, sums it up best. “Faced with the fact that several people who worked with Garrison quit and went public with their disagreement, the Garrisonites explain that these people were spies anyway. Faced with Big Jim's wild, constantly changing theories and enthusiasms, they explain that the spooks were feeding him disinformation. Faced with the negative press coverage he garnered, they explain that this was a "media campaign" against him. Faced with witnesses who fled New Orleans and refused to cooperate, they see the nefarious hand of conspirators undermining the DA’s case. To vindicate Garrison, they have to implicate virtually everybody else as a spook .” CIA Intervention? The last stage, according to DiEugenio, was run by the CIA itself through people like James Angleton and Richard Helms. They set up a “Garrison Group” within the CIA, and they “quashed subpoenas,” “flipped witnesses,” and “physically assaulted witnesses.” This was all in CIA documents “that originated in the office of [CIA Director] Richard Helms.” Robert Tanenbaum, former deputy chief counsel of the HSCA, told DiEugenio he had seen these documents. Unfortunately, they have simply vanished into thin air. [3] The CIA, under directions from the Justice Department, did nothing to help Clay Shaw and did not interfere with the Garrison investigation. Here’s the real story: Ramsey Clark, attorney general at the time, took an interest in the Garrison investigation from the beginning and asked the FBI to inform him if anything interesting develops. Lyndon Johnson called up Clark to make sure there was no “interfering or obstruction” of Garrison’s investigation, lest he start claiming the government was engaged in a cover-up. If any evidence of value turned up, he wanted to know. Clark called Johnson when David Ferrie died and told him that the Garrison investigation “from every indication … every piece of evidence that we had indicate[d that] highly erratic people were involved … [and there’s no] factual basis to support any of it.” The CIA was also watching, and a June 1967 memo says Garrison had “attacked CIA more vehemently, viciously, and mendaciously than any other American official or private citizen whose comments have come to our attention. In fact, he outstripped the foreign Communist press, which is now quoting him delightedly.” Clay Shaw’s legal team felt he was up against a “stacked deck.” In August 1967, they learned that one of their investigators was leaking information back to Garrison. And facing them was a juggernaut: Garrison had private money for his investigation, full control of the New Orleans legal system, and the resources of local and state police on call, all with little oversight. On top of this, Shaw’s spiraling costs for private investigators were eating into his nest egg, and his friends and family were scared. Who else might Garrison charge with conspiracy? So Shaw’s attorneys decided to go to Washington in September 1967 for help. Wegmann and Dymond met with Jack Miller, a former assistant attorney general, who agreed to help them. They wanted to meet with anybody at the CIA who could “steer them to the true facts and circumstances” relating to Garrison’s charges regarding the agency. Miller then spoke to the CIA’s general counsel Lawrence Houston, who then discovered that the Department of Justice did “not want the Agency to contact Shaw’s lawyers, but rather to maintain the safety of our executive privilege.” On September 21, 1967, Wegmann and Dymond met with Nathaniel Kossack, the first assistant in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, and gave him a list of people that Garrison might involve in the Shaw trial. Ramsey Clark was told that Wegmann and Dymond “presented a strong plea for investigative assistance and cooperation to help them refute charges that are otherwise unanswerable. Ultimately, their objective is access to information in the CIA files. Mr. Kossack said only that he would communicate with them further, without any pledge of assistance.” Donovan Pratt of the CIA wrote a memo for the record saying that “if Garrison learned of federal assistance to Shaw’s lawyers, he’d play it to the hilt.” He suggested that “Mr. Houston advise Mr. Kossack to tell Mr. Miller to propose to Shaw’s lawyers that they study the first volume [of the Warren Report], at least with care … If Shaw’s lawyers are confused by Garrison’s smoke screen, a careful study of the report ought to set them straight again.” The CIA had already set up a new committee called the Garrison Group, which met three times in September 1967 to address a major dilemma. Several people involved in the Garrison investigation had links to the CIA from their involvement in the fight against Castro. Others were falsely linked, but the CIA could not deny those claims without addressing the real ones. And the elephant in the room was Clay Shaw’s relationship as a contact of the domestic contact service from 1948 to 1956, something that Shaw’s lawyers did not even know about. “In view of this dilemma, the Department of Justice has so far taken the position that if any effort is made by either the prosecution or defense to involve CIA in the trial, the Government will claim executive privilege. This, too can be turned by Garrison into a claim that is part of the whole cover up by the establishment and particularly by CIA. No alternative to the claim of privilege appears to be available.” Therefore, “the Government cannot take any action publicly to refute Garrison’s claims and the testimony of his witnesses, as the Louisiana judge would almost certainly take the position that any such public statement would negate the privilege.” So “there is no action we can recommend for the Director of the Agency to take.” This presented a problem in that Clay Shaw’s “lawyers have no way of refuting these stories except by attacking the credibility of the witnesses or introducing other witnesses to impeach their stories. They have so far no Government information which they can use for this purpose.” Lastly, Houston wrote that “if during the trial it appears that Shaw may be convicted on information that could be refuted by CIA, we may be in for some difficult decisions.” Federal Government Stands Aside Shaw’s attorneys also failed with the FBI. On March 9, 1967, Wegmann phoned Robert Wick in the FBI’s public affairs office. He wanted Washington HQ to “instruct the New Orleans office … to cooperate … in supplying a ‘rap sheet’ (criminal or arrest record) of the individual Garrison names as the informant against Shaw.” The FBI refused to help. [4] FBI document 62-109060-4772, dated March 9, 1967. In April, the FBI learned of Wegmann’s wish to travel to Washington in order to discuss “the situation” with the director. He was informed that due to Hoover’s busy schedule, other officials at the Bureau handled such matters. The memo concluded by stating that the FBI would be happy to accept any information on the assassination that Wegmann could provide but that “the Bureau would not be able to offer Wegmann any assistance of any kind.” None of this was surprising given that the FBI was sitting on reports that Garrison had falsified his National Guard drill certifications—in other words, he had been fraudulently paid. Two sources reported this to the FBI, but as can be seen below, they decided to do nothing. Garrison resigned his commission. FBI memo dated May 16, 1967, from Branigan to Sullivan regarding James C. Garrison’s fraud against the government. Wegmann told author Patricia Lambert that he had managed to arrange a meeting with Robert Kennedy but that nothing had happened. Dymond and Wegmann then drafted a lengthy civil rights complaint to John Doar, assistant attorney general in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, which included details of Garrison’s bribery offers to Leemans and Beauboeuf (see Chapter 7). On March 21, 1968, they met with Stephen Pollak and John Kirby of the Civil Rights Division, who told them that “there was no basis for our conducting an investigation … that while [the Justice Department] does not endorse the methods which Wegmann alleges Garrison has used in this prosecution, that there does not appear to be a statutory basis for our proceeding at the present time.” Wegmann threatened to go public with his civil rights complaint, but Pollak agreed to review the materials one more time. Wegmann was puzzled about their reasons for refusing to proceed and wrote them a letter that expressed his anger and disappointment. “It is my opinion that the facts outlined … as supported and corroborated by the documents furnished to you, establish beyond any question of a doubt that the District Attorney’s case against Clay Shaw is pure fiction and that he is the victim of an unscrupulous and unconscionable public prosecutor … Certainly there can be no doubt but that the facts presented … warrant nothing less than an investigation of the situation by the Department or such other government agency as is appropriate.” On March 28, 1968, Pollak responded and said that “there is presently no basis for departmental investigation of your charges.” Shaw’s lawyers then filed a forty-five-page complaint in the US District Court in New Orleans asking it to provide “sanctuary” for Shaw and to grant “injunctive relief” against Garrison. Ultimately, this all failed—the court dismissed the complaint, and this was later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. After Shaw was charged with perjury in 1969, Shaw’s attorneys filed another civil rights complaint. David Bonderman, part of Richard Nixon’s new team at the DOJ, reviewed the request and claimed that “prosecutorial discretion covers at least the right to made bad, erroneous, and even silly decisions,” but that “does not extend to bribing witnesses to give false testimony.” He believed there was a legal basis for the DOJ to intervene but wished it could have been investigated back in 1967. He decided not to proceed, citing “the general problems in getting involved in the Garrison probe.” Patricia Lambert notes that “his memorandum shows Department of Justice officials so determined to keep their distance from Garrison that they abrogated their responsibility, statutory and moral, to Clay Shaw. They simply threw him to the wolves.” Bereft of any sort of valid conspiracy in the assassination, the Garrisonites cannot sustain their view that Kennedy was a martyr of his politics. Even so, they get his politics all wrong. His administration was waging war against Castro, including assassination attempts against Castro managed by the CIA with help from the mob and anti-Castro Cubans. The CIA was compelled to protect such a potentially explosive secret; it was no wonder that they were watching Garrison. The Real New Orleans Connection Garrison was right to think that New Orleans just might have been the incubator for the assassination, but not in the way he imagined. In June 1963, the Kennedy administration decided to step up covert operations inside Cuba. In August, anti-Castro Cubans shelled a Cuban factory. On September 5 two planes dropped bombs on Cuba, after which Fidel Castro gave an important interview on September 7. In it, he denounced “U.S.-prompted raids” and warned that “we are prepared to fight them and answer in kind. United States leaders should think that if they are aiding terrorist plans to eliminate Cuban leaders, they themselves will not be safe.” Castro’s interview was reported in the Times-Picayune , which Oswald most assuredly read. Author Jean Davison believes that, to Oswald, this might have seemed “like the king’s outcry against Becket: Who will rid me of this man?” In late September, Oswald visited the Cuban and Soviet embassies in Mexico City trying to get a visa to Cuba. He was turned away, and this must have added to his anger. He returned to New Orleans, moved to Dallas, and happened to get a job in a building where Kennedy’s motorcade would pass. Strictly by chance, Oswald was able to strike a blow for the revolution. While this was happening, the CIA was contacting a Cuban official, Rolando Cubela (code-named AM/LASH) to kill Castro and precipitate a coup. He wouldn’t proceed until he received a message from top officials in the U.S. government, and one was embedded in Kennedy’s speech in Miami on November 18, 1963. A poison pen letter was delivered to Cubela on the same day Kennedy was assassinated. To be fair, Kennedy also appeared to extend the hand of friendship to Castro through the efforts of William Attwood, who worked in the U.S. mission at the U.N. He had been told that Castro would make “substantial concessions” to the U.S. for normalization. Two journalists, Lisa Howard and Jean Daniel, made contact with Cuban officials. But Richard Helms, director of the CIA, told Congress that the accommodation effort was a “feint” and that the administration’s genuine efforts were focused on covert action. Researcher Gus Russo writes that Garrison came close to figuring it all out but got it backward. “Garrison was appallingly close to the heart of the coverup, but due to his immense ego and hatred of the government, he chose to see everything in reverse: 544 Camp St. was key to the case, but Garrison refused to see the obvious—Arcacha and the Cuban Revolutionary Council worked hand-in-glove with Bobby Kennedy and the White House; the camps on Lake Pontchartrain of which Garrison was aware, were a cog in the Central American plan of the Artime/Kennedy liaison, not part of an anti-Kennedy clique; Garrison was well-aware of the Rosselli admissions of the White house-backed anti-Castro plots.” Paul Hoch speculated that “the reason the CIA was so upset about Garrison was the threat he posed to the CIA’s mob connections, specifically the AM/LASH operation, the efforts to kill Castro, which in 1967 were a big secret. If Garrison pulled on the Anti-Castro Cuban thread there was a risk of unraveling all that.” Moving to Anti-Zionism The viciousness of the Garrisonites had now morphed into anti-Zionism. In 2018, a new book by Michele Metta, CMC: The Italian Undercover CIA and Mossad Station and the Assassination of JFK , ties Israel into the Permindex story. Metta quotes a paragraph on George Mantello from a CIA document on Permindex. But why wouldn’t the Israelis contact Mantello? He had saved thousands of Jews during the Holocaust and had intimate knowledge of Jewish displaced persons in Europe. From 1948 onward, thousands of Jews left Europe for the new state of Israel. There was nothing shameful about working with the Israelis. The fact that Metta sees this relationship as nefarious tells us more about Metta than Mantello. Metta goes further and states that in 1967 the brother of Shimon Peres, Gershon Peres, joined the Board of CMC. Why is this relevant? Well, David Ben-Gurion was prime minister of Israel when Kennedy was president. Shimon Peres was his “right-hand man,” and “Peres’ determination to reach the goal of an Israeli nuclear arsenal was absolutely no less callous than that of Ben-Gurion himself.” Kennedy was opposed to Israel obtaining the nuclear bomb, and “the leaders of the Jewish state saw Kennedy as the enemy.” Nothing could be further from the truth. Israel found itself isolated in the 1950s as the United States under Eisenhower kept its distance. The US-Israel relationship warmed under Kennedy, and Israel started receiving defensive arms from the United States. Facing genocidal neighbors, Israel asked for security guarantees. Kennedy demurred, and Israel made the decision to take her safety and security into her own hands, eventually arming herself with nuclear weapons. No one in Israel saw Kennedy as an enemy. Metta believes that the people who killed Kennedy were also responsible “for all the wrong-doings that today plague the destiny of Israel, plunging it down into a situation that the Jews exterminated by the gas chambers would certainly be ashamed of.” Is it any wonder that he then tells people they should not shout stupid phrases like “Hitler was right” or “Death to Israelis?” What else would he expect when people read that the Mossad was among the conspirators that killed JFK? And who do you think wrote a blurb for his front cover? None other than Oliver Stone, who called the book “Important … and it goes to the core of much of my movie I made, which is about fascism.” But what on earth does Oliver Stone know about fascism? After all, he believes that Putin has been a “stabilizing force” in Syria, and bombing hospitals doesn’t seem to concern him. Iran’s support of terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah do not bother him in the least, and he believes that Hugo Chavez was a champion of the people of Venezuela. He actually misses Fidel Castro. No doubt we’ll be hearing a lot more about this because Stone is working with James DiEugenio to adapt Destiny Betrayed into a three-part television documentary scheduled to air in the fall of 2020. He told the press that “This documentary film represents an important bookend to my 1991 film. It ties up many loose threads, and hopefully repudiates much of the ignorance around the case and the movie.” God help us! As I am writing this, the world is in the grips of the coronavirus pandemic. When we emerge, serious questions will have to be asked about the future of capitalism and global supply chains, how the thuggish and brutal Communist Party of China initially withheld important information about the transmissibility of the virus, and how we can reform the UN and its agencies to properly defend the rights of democratic peoples around the globe. The last thing any country needs is a populace steeped in conspiracy theories. But Oliver Stone would rather have us tilt at windmills, and I expect many people will lap it up, all too eager to fawn over a filmmaker who glorified Jim Garrison, a man who used his power and influence to ruin the lives of innocent people. Just then they came in sight of thirty or forty windmills that rise from that plain. And no sooner did Don Quixote see them that he said to his squire, "Fortune is guiding our affairs better than we ourselves could have wished. Do you see over yonder, friend Sancho, thirty or forty hulking giants? I intend to do battle with them and slay them. With their spoils we shall begin to be rich for this is a righteous war and the removal of so foul a brood from off the face of the earth is a service God will bless." "What giants?" asked Sancho Panza. "Those you see over there," replied his master, "with their long arms. Some of them have arms well nigh two leagues in length." "Take care, sir," cried Sancho. "Those over there are not giants but windmills. Those things that seem to be their arms are sails which, when they are whirled around by the wind, turn the millstone." [1] Harold Weisberg accompanied Assistant DA Andrew Sciambra in Washington to interview witnesses who were certain they had not seen Shaw. Because of the lack of discovery in Louisiana courts, Shaw’s lawyers were not informed of these witnesses. [2] Novel was never an operative for the CIA. A CIA report from May 31, 1967, said that “Gordon Dwane Novel has both claimed and denied affiliation with CIA. A thorough records check has shown no such affiliation.” The CIA then used alternate spellings of his name and came up negative. They even asked JMWAVE, a secret covert operations center in Miami, to show Novel’s photo “to a well-placed and well-informed asset” to “test the possibility that Novel had been involved in CIA activities under another name.” That also came up negative. Novel’s lawyer Elmer Gertz wrote Edward Wegmann that “you know him well enough to take what he says with at least one grain of salt; I would say a whole salt shaker.” [3] Tanenbaum claimed to have seen a video Ferrie had taken with Oswald, Banister, and others at an anti-Castro training camp. That video has also disappeared. Tanenbaum resigned from the HSCA after Chief Investigator Richard Sprague was forced out early in the probe. [4] Attorney General Ramsey Clark stated on March 2, 1967, that Shaw had been cleared by the FBI in 1963. He misspoke and was referring to the fact that the FBI and Warren Commission had looked into the story about a Clay Bertrand. There are no FBI files from 1963 or 1964 that refer to Clay Shaw, which is to be expected since he was not investigated. Hoover wrote on the memo above that “A.G. made the statement, so it is up to the Dept [of Justice] to wrestle with this.” Notes and Sources They all suffer from “invincible ignorance ”: James Phelan used this term in a telephone conversation with Patricia Lambert on August 11, 1991, Papers of Patricia Lambert.

Kennedy Assassination So-Called Photo Experts T he conspiracy books and videos can produce all kinds of "experts" to claim that the photos of Oswald standing in his backyard with a Mannlicher-Carcano rifle were faked. The same "experts" will say that the photos and x-rays made at Kennedy's autopsy were forged, and that virtually each and every photo and film of the assassination contains indisputable proof that a conspiracy killed Kennedy. There is one interesting thing about the conspiracy "experts," however. None of them makes a living analyzing photos. Nobody will pay any of them for their expertise — with the exception of the O.J. Simpson defense which paid Robert Groden to testify that a photo of the defendent was faked. That produced one of the monumental fiascos of American law. There are, however, talented amateurs in many walks of life, so could it be that the "photo experts" are responsible and competent analysts? Let's look at the evidence. Tom Wilson: Finding Things that Don't Exist in Photos The man at right is the late Tom Wilson, an analyst who used computer "enhancements" of photos to discover evidence of a conspiracy. His accomplishments are many. For example, his analysis of the Zapruder film showed a bullet entering Kennedy's body from the front — iron-clad evidence of a shot from the Grassy Knoll. His computer even pinpointed the place in Kennedy's suit jacket where the bullet entered. Unfortunately for Wilson, Kennedy's jacket is in the National Archives in College Park, Maryland. It has no bullet hole in the front . Wilson was one of the stars of the new edition of The Men Who Killed Kennedy that showed on American TV in 1996. Wilson's analysis of the Moorman Polaroid photo revealed the trajectory of the bullet that struck Kennedy in the head from the front. The shot came from the storm sewer! To the left is a scene from the show. Jack Brazil, long a proponent of the "sewer theory" is pictured in the storm sewer. Unfortunately, the sewer is a terrible shooting location, and Kennedy's head would not have been visible from within the sewer at Zapruder frame 313, when it it seen to explode. Tom's Tall Tale Conspiracy-oriented researchers have long claimed that the Kennedy autopsy photos and x-rays, which reside in the National Archives, have been faked, forged, or tampered with. Wilson went a step further. He claimed to have gained special access at the Archives and actually seen the materials used in the photo forgery . Tom Wilson Goes to Court The test of any supposed forensic technique is how it fares in court, where lawyers on both sides get to cross-examine "expert" witnesses. As with Bob Groden (see below), when Tom Wilson took his Magic Camera into court, it didn't impress . Groden and Livingstone: Don't Like What a Photo Shows? Just Rotate it Ninety Degrees! That's what "photo experts" like Robert Groden (in The Killing of a President , page 81) and Harrison Livingstone (in High Treason II ) do. Wanting to show the back of Kennedy's head blown out — and thus push the notion of a Grassy Knoll shooter — they use a close-up autopsy photo of the inside of Kennedy's skull after the brain was removed. By rotating the photo ninety degrees clockwise , they can make it appear that the photo shows a large defect in the back of Kennedy's head. In actuality, Kennedy was photographed from the front, and the photo shows the top if his head blasted out, as shown in this drawing by Dr. Robert Artwohl . Finally, a large and properly-oriented copy of the head photo. Groden: Turning a Shotgun into a Rifle I n both his video, The Assassination Films , and in his book The Killing of a President , Robert Groden shows a segment from an amateur film by Charles Mentesana that pictures a policeman holding a gun. He says that the gun is a "second rifle" brought down from the Texas School Book Depository, and says that the gun is "not a Carcano, and has never been placed into evidence." Sounds spooky, right? Two rifles in the Depository. When Groden first showed his video at the 1995 COPA convention, Tony Marsh wrote him to correct this mistake: Several of us in the audience were very troubled by your narration of some films. You are the leading photographic interpreter in the research community and many people will take your word as gospel. So, it is especially important that your video not perpetuate any myths. For example, in the Mentesana footage you state that the policeman is holding a second rifle, found in the TSBD. That is not a rifle; it is a shotgun. The barrel and the bore are too big in diameter for a rifle. Some shotguns have distinctive profiles and magazine caps by which we can identify them at a glance. The shotgun the policeman was holding was his Remington 870. I have enclosed some examples of that model for you to compare to the Mentesana footage. I have reduced a diagram of the Remington 870 to about the same size as an overlay transparency of the Mentesana frame from your book so that you can see for yourself that they have the same profile at the same size. Also, one of the cops in the tramp photos carried a Remington 870. There were at least three different makes and models of shotguns used by the DPD and the Remington 870 is one of the most popular police shotguns. Interestingly, still photos and films of Dallas cops holding shotguns that are apparently identical to the one in the Mentesana film are plentiful. But Groden neither prints any of them in his book, nor includes any in his video. Needless to say, Groden has not corrected his mistake. Robert Groden in Court: Photo of O.J. Simpson Faked When Bob Groden goes to conspiracy conventions and tells the audience how the autopsy photos and x-rays or the backyard photos of Oswald are faked, he is a big hit. When Groden testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations, they listened politely, and said they didn't believe him. But what happened when Groden testified in an adversarial proceeding, when counsel for the other side had a strong interesting in proving him to be a complete idiot? The carnage was legandary! The following are portions of transcripts from the O.J. Simpson civil trial. Groden testified for the defense, claiming that a photo of Simpson in Bruno Magli shoes had been forged. Day One — Groden says photo of Simpson has been altered . Day Two — Plaintiff's lawyer cross-examines Groden , attacking his credentials, motives, memory, and issue of Groden having stolen photos from the House Select Committee. Day Three — Further cross-examination . Plaintiff's lawyer shows Groden 30 additional photos of Simpson wearing Bruno Maglis. Asks him whether each is forged. Day Four — Testimony of E.J. Flammer , freelance photographer who took photos of Simpson. Also, Gerald Richards, a forensic photographic expert. Day Five — Gerald Richards continued , plus testimony of shoe expert Bodziak, who testifies that shoes in Flammer photos are Bruno Maglis. Robert Groden: Seeing a Man in a Photo Who Isn't There When Lee Oswald passed out leaflets in front of the International Trade Mart in New Orleans, a local camerman photographed him. In the background of this film footage is a man who Robert Groden believes is Clay Shaw, supposed conspirator in the assassination. So there is a link between Shaw and Oswald. Unfortunately, a little research would have shown that the man isn't Clay Shaw . Jack White, James Fetzer, David Mantik: Mary Moorman Standing in Elm Street One of the truly outlandish projects of assassination researchers during the past decade has been to prove that the Zapruder film — long claimed to be iron-clad conspiracy evidence — was in fact tampered with and faked by U.S. government agencies. One piece of evidence produced to support this notion was an analysis of "sight lines" in the Moorman Polaroid that supposedly proved that Mary Moorman was standing in Elm Street when she shot the picture. Since the Zapruder film shows her standing on the grass of the Dealey Plaza infield, the Zapruder film was tampered with, and Moorman's position changed. Unfortunately, a careful replication of the analysis by Gary Mack and Josiah Thompson showed Moorman to have been on the grass exactly where the Zapruder film shows her. Jack White: "Photogrammetry?" What's That? Photo "expert" Jack White is convinced that the backyard photos of Oswald holding the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle are faked. Part of his "evidence" for this is supposed discrepancies in the dimensions of various parts of the rifle in different photos. How does one measure the dimensions of objects in photos? Is it as simple as holding a ruler up against the photo? Read on. Key Concept: Photogrammetry. Defined as the science of making reliable measurements by the use of (usually) aerial photographs in surveying and map making. No one can make any meaningful statements about the relative dimensions of objects in photographs without knowing the basics of photogrammetry. When Jack White gave extensive testimony to the House Select Committee about supposed "discrepancies" in the backyard photos, and various photos of Oswald's rifle, he was grilled about his expertise by HSCA counsel Mickey Goldsmith. The following is from volume II of the House Select Committee. For a fuller transcript of White's testimony, click here . For the testimony of a bona fide expert in photogrammetry, explaining how the concept matters, click here . Mr. GOLDSMITH. I see that you have taken a ruler and placed it by Oswald's body and also by his rifle; is that correct? Mr. WHITE. Yes. Mr. GOLDSMITH. Mr. White, do you believe that an object photographed can be measured simply by placing a ruler against the image in the photograph? Mr. WHITE. No. Mr. GOLDSMITH. When you measured the object in this photograph, what did you do beyond using the ruler? Mr. WHITE. This is strictly a two-dimensional measurement. Obviously I did not take into consideration any perspective which might exist or any other considerations. It is just a mere measurement of the body from the weightbearing foot to the top of the head in each case and of the rifle from the muzzle to the butt. Mr. GOLDSMITH. Without giving any account to other factors? Mr. WHITE. That is true. I am not a physicist or any sort of a scientist who could determine anything relating to the perspective. We don't know how close the rifle is to his body. We don't know how close the camera is to the subject, so it would be virtually impossible for just a plain citizen like me to interpret the perspective of this photograph. Mr. GOLDSMITH. Have you had any training in analytical photogrammetry? Mr. WHITE. No. Mr. GOLDSMITH. Have you had any formal training in forensic photography? Mr. WHITE. No. [...] Mr. GOLDSMITH. Mr. White, you have made reference to several points in these photographs that suggest that Oswald's head is disproportionately---- I withdraw the question. That the body of Oswald is not consistent in the various photographs in light of the head size; is that correct? Mr. WHITE. Yes. Mr. GOLDSMITH. To what extent, if any, did you compute photogrammetrically the effect of an object's tilt on its apparent length in the photograph? Mr. WHITE. As I said, I am not a scientist. I don't indulge in that sort of thing. [...] Mr. GOLDSMITH. Mr. White, I just have one question. Mr. WHITE. All right. Mr. GOLDSMITH. When you did this study, did you compute photogrammetrically the effect of tilt on the way that the length of an object appears in a photograph? Mr. WHITE. I conducted a study by photographing a yardstick from three different- Mr. GOLDSMITH. Mr. White, answer my question. Did you compute photogrammetrically---- Mr. WHITE. What is "photogrammetrically"? Describe to me what "photogrammetrically" is. Mr. GOLDSMITH. I just have one more question Mr. White. Do you know what photogrammetry is? Mr. WHITE. No. Mr. GOLDSMITH. I have no further questions. Thank you. What Do People Who Earn Their Living Analyzing Photos Say?

Jean Hill -- The Lady in Red in Dealey Plaza During the Kennedy Assassination Jean Hill: The Lady in Red "It was right up there. The man was shooting from right just this side of that tree . . . that large tree, and that's where I saw the shot come from" -- Jean Hill in 1992 video Beyond JFK (above). Your browser does not support the video tag. S he's in most of the conspiracy videos and conspiracy books. The late Jean Hill claimed to have seen a shooter on the Grassy Knoll at the moment Kennedy was hit in the head by a bullet on November 22nd, 1963. From the beginning, her testimony was interesting, sometimes funny, and has implied a conspiracy. But that's not to say it was consistent. Consider for example her claim to have seen a Grassy Knoll shooter. A little more than an hour after the shooting, on the afternoon of the assassination, she was interviewed by WBAP-TV. (See right. Hill is on the left in the video, and her friend Mary Moorman, who was standing next to Hill on the Dealey Plaza infield, is on the right). Q. "Did you see the person who fired the . . ." A. "No . . . I didn't see any person fire the weapon . . ." Q. "You only heard it?" A. "I only heard it." Hill's testimony had substantial credibility problems on other issues too. The following chart summarizes key elements of her testimony, and evaluates each. The Testimony of Jean Hill Her Latter-Day Claim Was she saying this in 1963-64? Evaluation Was in Dealey Plaza at the time of the shooting Yes She is plainly visible in several films and still photos in her red raincoat. She came to see "J.B. Marshall" [sic] her boyfriend, who was a motorcycle cop escorting the presidential limo No The officer she describes is not "J.B. Marshall," but rather B.J. Martin. She stepped into Elm Street and shouted "Hey, Mr. President, look this way. We want to take your picture." Almost touched front fender of limo. Sort of. Her Warren Commission testimony is that she was on the "edge" of the street. Contradicted by photographic evidence, which shows her several feet from the curb and not moving. Saw a little dog in the limo between John Kennedy and Jackie Yes An odd but doubtless sincere observation. May have mistaken bouquet of chrysanthemums in limo for small dog. Various photos show Jackie with flowers at Love Field , and in the limo . Heard four to six shots Yes This places her among a tiny minority of witnesses who heard more than three shots, although there is no reason to doubt her sincerity. She saw a shooter on the Grassy Knoll in the "Badgeman" position No Flatly contradicts her statement on the day of the assassination (see above). The "whole back" of Kennedy's head exploded as he was hit No She told the Warren Commission that Kennedy's hair "rippled up" with no mention of the back of his head exploding. Ran across Elm Street up the Grassy Knoll so quickly she failed to see Jackie climbing out onto trunk of presidential limo, and was almost hit by motorcycle of officer escorting limo. Yes Photos by Wilma Bond show her first sitting , and then standing in position on Dealey Plaza infield for over a minute after the shooting, long after other bystanders had run up the Knoll. Saw Jack Ruby running from the corner of the Texas School Book Depository behind the Pergola toward the railroad yards Yes She doubtless saw a man running, but Jack Ruby was at the offices of the Dallas Morning News and could not have been in Dealey Plaza. Claims to have been waylaid by Secret Service agents immediately after the assassination, intimidated, and told she must say there were only three shots fired. No Her affidavit of November 22nd, 1963 , says that after the shooting she went with Mary Moorman and "Mr. Featherstone [sic] of the Times-Herald " to the press room of the Sheriff's office. Both Featherston and Moorman confirm that her original statement, rather than her latter-day claims, is true. Her boyfriend, Officer "J.B. Marshall" [sic] told her that the presidential motorcade route was changed at the last minute No The "changed motorcade route" story is repeated in many books about the assassination, but in fact it did not happen . "Marshall" told her that Lyndon Johnson "ducked down" before any shots were fired. No Johnson was forced down by Secret Service agent Rufus W. Youngblood who reacted immediately when the shooting started. Her Warren Commission testimony, as reported in the Commission volumes, was very different from what she actually said. No Her published testimony is consistent with other statements she made in 1963-64, although not with her current claims. It also contains several elements that imply a conspiracy -- including four to six shots, hearing shots from the Knoll, and seeing Jack Ruby in Dealey Plaza. There have been attempts on her life No No supporting evidence has been produced. If attempts she describes in her book were real, they were extremely lame Sources: Anthony Summers, Conspiracy ; pp. 28, 50-51, Jim Marrs, Crossfire , pp. 37-38, 322-324; Richard Trask, Pictures of the Pain , pp. 232-242; Bill Sloan with Jean Hill, The Last Dissenting Witness . Jean Hill (left) and her friend Mary Moorman (shooting polaroid photo) in the Zapruder film about a second before the head shot that killed Kennedy. Hill is not even looking at JFK. Sequestered and Intimidated by Goons Hill's claim to have been taken by officials (or people claiming to be officials) to some location near the Plaza and intimidated is enacted fairly accurately by actress Ellen McElduff in the movie "JFK:" Your browser does not support the video tag. Since there were several media interviews of Hill after the supposed session with the goons, we might want to see whether Hill looks to be frightened, intimidated or cowed during these interviews. Your browser does not support the video tag. At right, you can see an interview conducted by Bill Lord of ABC late in day on November 22. Given that her original affidavit says she and Mary Moorman went with Mr. Featherstone [sic] to the press room in the Sheriff's office, we might want to know if Moorman and Jim Featherston can confirm her story. First, Featherstone: I ran to Dealey Plaza, a few yards away, and this is where I first learned the president had been shot. I found two young women, Mary Moorman and Jean Lollis Hill, near the curb on Dealey Plaza. Both had been within a few feet of the spot where Kennedy was shot, and Mary Moorman had taken a Polaroid picture of Jackie Kennedy cradling the president's head in her arms.... I told Mrs. Moorman I wanted the picture for the Times Herald and she agreed. I then told both of them I would like for them to come with me to the courthouse pressroom so I could get their stories and both agreed. . . . Before long, the pressroom became filled with other newsmen. Mrs. Hill told her story over and over again for television and radio. Each time, she would embellish it a bit until her version began to sound like Dodge City at high noon. She told of a man running up toward the now-famed grassy knoll pursued by other men she believed to be policemen. In the meantime, I had talked to other witnesses and at one point I told Mrs. Hill she shouldn't be saying some of the things she was telling television and radio reporters. I was merely trying to save her later embarrassment but she apparently attached intrigue to my warning. Mary Moorman Speaks It has long been know by JFK researchers (and is in fact conceded in Jean Hill's book The Last Dissenting Witness ) that Mary Moorman does not support Hill's version of events following the shooting. Finally, in 2011, Moorman did an on-the-record interview explicitly denying certain elements of Hill's testimony, and most especially the notion that goons had taken Hill, sequestered her, and tried to intimidate her. Moorman sets the record straight in the video below. Your browser does not support the video tag. Jean Hill died in November, 2000. Here is a highly sympathetic obituary from the JFK Lancer web site.

Plausible Denial, Mark Lane, E. Howard Hunt, and the Liberty Lobby Trial Did Mark Lane Convince a Jury that E. Howard Hunt was a Kennedy Assassination Conspirator? Implausible Assertions M ark Lane is a lawyer. That’s a good starting point for understanding his approach to the Kennedy assassination. Lawyers can get in trouble for telling outright lies, but they are free to – indeed are expected to – present only that information that serves the interests of their clients. They are free to – indeed are expected to – spin any piece of information to benefit their clients. In a legal proceeding where both sides have competent legal counsel, this is the way an adversarial system of justice works. But it’s not a good way to write a book. Which brings us to Plausible Denial , Lane’s conspiracy volume published in 1991. The book is a hodgepodge of conspiracy arguments and conspiracy claims, but the central focus is on a trial in which ex-CIA operative E. Howard Hunt sued the Liberty Lobby for libel. The Liberty Lobby was a rather nasty anti-Semitic operation that published a magazine called The Spotlight. In 1976, The Spotlight ran an article accusing Hunt of being in Dallas on November 22, 1963, and having a role in the Kennedy assassination. Hunt won a libel judgment against The Spotlight in 1981, but it was thrown out on appeal, and the case was retried in 1985 in Miami. Lane, a Jew, defended the Liberty Lobby. To hear Lane tell it, he convinced the jury that there was a conspiracy in the Kennedy assassination, and that Hunt was a part of that conspiracy. Where was E. Howard Hunt in November 22, 1963? Lane’s first tactic to convict Hunt is to claim that the latter had no alibi for November 22, 1963. Of course, Lane has to admit that Hunt’s fellow CIA employees said he was in Washington, DC., but he strongly implies that they must have been lying. First, Lane discusses one Walter Kuzmuk. Kuzmuk was a CIA officer who had worked with Hunt. To the jurors at the first trial, his testimony may have seemed dispositive of the question of Hunt’s whereabouts on November 22, 1963; an experienced, ranking officer of the CIA had seen him in Washington just as the president was being shot in Dallas. According to Kuzmuk, Hunt and his wife had driven by in the early afternoon of November 22 as he exited from a downtown Washington restaurant. Kuzmuk repeated this testimony at the second trial. Since Kuzmuk worked for the CIA, Lane can assume that conspiracy-oriented readers will happily accept that he was a liar, so Lane asks rhetorically, “Was Kuzmuk a CIA-arranged witness?” Lane then nitpicks Kuzmuk’s testimony, attempting to convince readers that minor discrepancies are the tip-off that Kuzmuk is indeed lying. Another witness to Hunt being in Washington, indeed at the CIA, on the day of the assassination was Connie Mazerov. In contrast to other witnesses, who are quoted a length, Lane offers one dismissive paragraph on her. Connie Mazerov offered the most pathetic testimony I had encountered in some time. It was a sad rendition of the stand-by-your-man theme . . . . She had seen Hunt early that morning. As to the meetings he was supposed to have attended later that morning (according to one of Hunt’s versions of events), she couldn’t recall seeing him there. She never saw anyone else that morning who could have seen him. She was apparently willing to help Hunt out, but not if she had to name a single other person who might come forward to dispute her account. Lane, faced with a witness who confirms Hunt’s presence at CIA headquarters, in effect calls her a liar and spins her lack knowledge of precise details of events that happened 22 years before as evidence that she lied.. But Hunt had yet a third CIA alibi witness, whom Lane conceals from his readers. Lane throws out a red herring by mentioning a woman supposedly called “Betty McDonald.” When [Walter] Kuzmuk was asked who might have seen Hunt that day if he had been in the office, he replied Betty McDonald. He did not mention Mazerov. The plaintiff did not call McDonald; Hunt explained that she had been absent that day. Lane is right that no “Betty McDonald” testified. But the woman in question was actually named Elizabeth (“Betty”) Macintosh and she did appear and supported Hunt. While Lane has avoided literally telling a lie, he has pulled a stunt that would get him disbarred if tried before any judge. But Lane can be confident that the vast majority of his readers have no way of knowing what he’s doing. Did Hunt’s Family Say He Was in DC? Since Hunt claimed to have been in the Washington area, and to have spent the afternoon with his family, it might seem important to ask what they say about his whereabouts. And if you believe Lane, the answer is damning. Lane extensively quotes his own cross-examination of Hunt to throw Hunt’s alibi into question. Q. Do you recall testifying back on December 16, 1981, that when the allegation was made that you were in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, your children were really upset? Do you recall testifying to that? A. Yes. Q. Do you recall testifying that you had to reassure them that you were not in Texas that day? A. Yes. Q. That you had nothing to do with the Kennedy assassination? A. That’s right. Q. And that you were being persecuted for reasons that were unknown to you? A. Yes. Q. Did you say that the allegation that you were in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, was the focus of a great deal of interfamily friction, and tended to exacerbate difficulties in the family? A. I did. . . . “Mr. Hunt, why did you have to convince your children that you were not in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, if, in fact, as you say, a fourteen-year-old daughter, a thirteen-year-old daughter, and a ten-year old son were with you in the Washington, D.C., area on November 22, 1963, and were with you at least for the next forty-eight hours, as you all stayed glued to the T.V. set?” If someone had struck Hunt in the face his reaction would not have been more physical. His head jerked back. . . . The delay before Hunt responded seemed interminable. In absolute time it probably was not more than half a minute. Finally Hunt spoke, looking away from the jurors: “May I reply?” I answered, “Please. It is a question.” He spoke quickly, as if he hoped the subject would soon be forgotten. “These were unformed minds, and I felt that it was absolutely imperative that I remind them of the circumstances attendant upon our family that day. “Yet, my other son, Howard St. John, had read in the Berkeley Barb and in other papers these constant reiterations of my involvement in the Kennedy assassination. “So, it was less a question of my convincing them that I was in Washington, D.C., with them – rather, reminding them that I was – than it was to assure them that none of the charges and allegations that had been made, particularly those of the tramp in Dealey Plaza, had any substance to them at all.” . . . Q. One can see where they might be disturbed that you were being charged with this. But weren’t they of the opinion that there were three people who could prove to the whole world that these charges were a tissue of lies, that “I was with my father during that whole time period?” What I want to know is since they knew how outrageous the lies were, why did they have to be convinced by you that you weren’t in Texas? A. Reminded, reminded. Q. They didn’t remember that themselves? Hunt paused again. He wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. A. The constant reiteration of these charges, in one form or another, had an extremely deleterious effect on my children. I conferred with them, I answered their questions. I gave them every assurance that I was never in Dealey Plaza at any time in my life – not only on the fatal day, but the day before, the day after. In short, never. That was the type of assurance I was forced to give to my family. . . . Hunt’s explanations only exacerbated the matter. If the three children had been exposed to the false allegations over a period of time, does it not seem likely that they would remember somewhere along the line where they had spent one of the most traumatic moments of their lives and who had been with them? Why had they not shouted out that their father was innocent? Failing that, how could they require constant reminders from their father that they had all been together that day? The record revealed that as each new allegation was made, asserting that E. Howard Hunt had been in Dallas on November 22, 1963, the children, then adults, demanded to know if the charges were true. . . . These three witnesses were to offer the essential testimony placing Hunt hundreds of miles from the crime. They, not the two CIA-arranged witnesses, held in their hands the alibi their father so desperately required. This testimony might seem terribly damning, but only because Lane has omitted some key facts. In 1974 the Rockefeller Commission investigated Hunt’s whereabouts on the day of the assassination. First, Hunt testified under oath that he was in the Washington area. Two of his children also testified that he was there, as did a domestic employee of his family. (A son of Hunt’s who was nine years old did not remember where his parents were that day, and Hunt’s youngest son had not been born. Hunt’s wife was deceased by the time of the Commission.) Lane most certainly knew about the Rockefeller Commission, since he mentions it in Plausible Denial . So a total of six people had testified that Hunt was in Washington on the day of the assassination. Lane lacks the chutzpah to conceal all of them, so he mentions, and denigrates, two who worked for the CIA. He conceals the other CIA witness ( Elizabeth Macintosh) by using another witness’ confusion about her name. And he entirely conceals the fact that three witnesses in the Hunt household (two children and a domestic) told the Rockefeller Commission that he was there. Mark Lane has a history of chronic manipulation of evidence: Lane used unreliable testimony to accuse American soldiers of multiple atrocities during the Vietnam War Lane misrepresented the testimony of a Tippit shooting witness, Helen Markham, to the Warren Commission Lane, in his book Rush to Judgment , misrepresented the Warren Commission testimony of Jack Ruby Marita Lorenz: Tying Hunt to a Conspiracy Having convinced uninformed and perhaps credulous readers that Hunt had no reliable alibi for his whereabouts on the day of the assassination, Lane now proceeds to tie Hunt to the assassination plot. To do so, he produces one single witness, a woman named Marita Lorenz. Lorenz claimed to have been a CIA operative who was Castro’s mistress. Lorenz testified via a deposition that was read to the court. She told of an assassination caravan consisting of two cars and several conspirators who drove from Miami to Dallas before the assassination, arriving on November 21 st . Most significantly, for the purposes of the trial, her testimony placed Hunt – using the name “Eduardo” – at the motel where the conspirators were staying, giving them a sum of money. If Lorenz was telling the truth, then Hunt was most certainly an assassination conspirator. But Lane fails to tell his readers that her testimony had been in the public domain for several years, and had been found to lack credibility – even among conspiracy-oriented researchers who wanted to blame the CIA for the assassination. During 1977 and 1978, Lorenz’ claims were extensively investigated by the House Select Committee on Assassinations. Chief Counsel Robert Blakey outlined the Committee’s conclusions: We also rejected the story of Marita Lorenz, who told us she had driven from Miami to Dallas on November 15, 1963, with Oswald and several anti-Castro activists, including Gerry Patrick Hemming, Orlando Bosch, a terrorist . . . Pedro Diaz-Lanz, the former Cuban Air Force chief, and Frank Sturgis, who was arrested in the Watergate break-in in 1972. All four men denied Lorenz’s charge emphatically, and we could find no evidence to refute them. Lorenz, who claimed to have been Fidel Castro’s mistress as well as the instrument of an attempt by the CIA to poison Castro . . . did not help her credibility by telling us that when she arrived in Dallas with Oswald and the anti-Castro activists, they were contacted at their motel by Jack Ruby. Jack Ruby’s whereabouts were tracked in meticulous detail by the Warren Commission, and there is no possibility he could have gone to any motel as Lorenz described. Likewise, Oswald’s whereabouts were also well accounted for during the days before the assassination, and a car trip by him from Miami to Dallas was entirely out of the question. So what happened to Oswald in Lorenz’ trial testimony? The following is from her deposition for the Hunt v. Liberty Lobby trial. Q. [from Hunt’s lawyer, Mr. Dunne] Who were the people in the cars? A. Some of our co-workers and Sturgis. Why? Do we have to name these? MR. LANE: That is up to you to answer the question. A. The other one was Jerry Patrick -- Q. Jerry Patrick? A. Hemming. Q. Is that, H-e-m-m-i-n-g? A. Yes. [....] Q. You identified yourself in the car, yourself, Mr. Sturgis and Hemming? A. Yes; yes, a pilot. Q. Who was the pilot? A. I will not name it now. [...] Q. How many people all told, were in the car? A. [Lorenz] Four. Q. Four in one car? A. Yes. Q. What about the second car? A. I don’t know. Q. So you have identified three people and there was a pilot? A. And Pedro Diaz Lanz, was his name, L-a-n-z. Q Was Lee Harvey Oswald in your car? A. In the other car, back-up car. Q. Is there a reason why you wouldn’t tell me that when I asked you the question? A. No. Q. Who else was in the back-up car? A. Two brothers; two Cuban brothers. Q. What were their names? A. Novis. If that’s what Marita Lorenz actually said, what does Lane tell us about her testimony in Plausible Denial ? At the deposition, Hunt’s lawyer demanded that she provide the name of one more person in the automobile with her. She looked at me, stared at Dunne as if to say, “Well, you asked for this,” and responded: A: The other one was Jerry Patrick . . . . Q: Jerry Patrick . . . ? A: Hemming. Q: Is that, H-E-M-M-I-N-G? A: Yes. She added that two Cuban brothers named Novis and a pilot named Pedro Diaz Lanz were also in the caravan. After the deposition I discussed that question with her. [. . . .] It seems that Lane, fully realizing this problem with Lorenz’ account, has given us a sanitized version of her testimony. But this wasn’t the only thing sanitized by Lane. Consider, for example, the following portion of the Lorenz deposition: Q. When was the first time you met Lee Harvey Oswald? MR. LANE: She did not say she met him. MR. DUNNE: She testified he was in the car. Q. Did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald? A. While we were training in the Bay of Pigs for the Bay of Pigs. [sic] Q. The invasion. A. Yes. Q. You met Lee Harvey Oswald there? A. Yes. Q. The Bay of Pigs was in mid- to late-1962? A. Yes, April 21 st . Q. So you met Lee Harvey Oswald, was it late 1961 or early 1962? MR. LANE: If you recall. A. If I recall, 1962. I don’t remember exactly; he wanted to be part of the invasion. Q. You were going through some kind of commando training? A. Guerrilla. Q. Where was that occurring? A. In the Everglades, Central American countries. [....] Q. What did you know Lee Harvey Oswald as? A. Ozzie. Q. Can you give me a month, to the best of your recollection, when you first met him? MR. LANE: She said she – MR. DUNNE: That was my question. A. We were training for about a year. I recall that. Q. Was he there most of the time of the training? A. Sometimes; not always, depending on what type of training we had. Q. Did you used to see him all the time when once he started going around? A. No; just several times. Q. He went through some of the courses with you? A. Yes. Of course, the Bay of Pigs was actually in April 1961, but that’s not of great import, since Lee Oswald was in the Soviet Union from September 1959 until June 1962! Thus it’s hardly surprising that the House Select Committee didn’t believe her. Of course Blakey wasn’t inclined to blame the CIA for the assassination, but some members of the HSCA staff were. One of them was Gaeton Fonzi. Fonzi was intimately involved in investigating the Lorenz story, and his book The Last Investigation gave a blow by blow account of how her testimony developed . Fonzi concluded that her testimony was merely a “diversion” and that it “injected a dose of slapstick” into the investigation. Fonzi’s colleague Ed Lopez was even more blunt. He told author Gerald Posner: Oh God, we spent a lot of time with Marita . . . . It was hard to ignore her because she gave us so much crap, and we tried to verify it, but let me tell you – she is full of shit. Between her and Frank Sturgis, we must have spent over one hundred hours. They were dead ends . . . . Marita is not credible. Yet Lane gives his readers not even the tiniest hint that Lorenz’ testimony is anything but perfectly believable. Did the Jurors Believe that Hunt Was a Conspirator? If Lane’s evidence against Hunt was as strong as he leads the reader to believe, we would expect it to convince the jury, and indeed the jury did rule against Hunt and in favor of the Liberty Lobby. However, when a “public figure” like E. Howard Hunt is attacked in the media, he cannot win a libel judgment merely by showing that the attack is untrue and unfair. Under a 1964 Supreme Court decision called New York Times v. Sullivan , the plaintiff must show “actual malice” on the part of the defendant. Lane explains the Sullivan decision to his readers, but insists that it had nothing to do with the jury’s verdict, since the jurors believed that Hunt was indeed an assassination conspirator. To support his position, Lane cites jury Foreperson Leslie Armstrong. Lane describes Armstrong’s statements to the media as follows: The evidence was clear, she said. The CIA had killed President Kennedy. Hunt had been part of it, and that evidence, so painstakingly presented should now be examined by the relevant institutions of the United States government so that those responsible for the assassination might be brought to justice. Armstrong apparently did say that, and doubtless believed it. But there were five other jurors. Two of them told the Miami Herald that they most certainly did not believe that Lane had proven that Hunt was a conspirator. Suzanne Reach said that “We were very disgusted and felt it was trash . . . . The paper published material that was sloppy – but it wasn’t malicious.” Reach added that “We were worried that our verdict might give the wrong impression to the public” and added that Lane’s conspiracy theories were “absolutely not” the reason for the verdict. The Herald also quoted another juror, who refused to be identified, saying that the verdict was the result of Hunt failing to demonstrate that the article was published with “reckless disregard for the truth,” and added that Lane’s conspiracy theories were “so much extraneous matter.” Likewise, an unidentified juror told the Associated Press that (in the words of the AP reporter) “no evidence was presented showing malice toward Hunt by the publication.” Finally, juror L. L. Cobb told United Press that the jury was concerned about whether the article was damaging to Hunt, not whether it was true. Quoting the UPI story: “What we looked at was the article and whether there was any instances of malice,” she said. “We did not find any because there had been many stories written about the issue.” Thus, depending on whether the unidentified juror in the Miami Herald story is the same person as the juror quoted by the Associated Press, three or four of the six jurors went on record as denying Lane’s claims to have proven a conspiracy. But Lane ignores them and quotes the single juror whose statements are convenient. Interestingly, Lane discusses Judge James Kehoe’s instructions to the jury in one bland sentence. Lane says that “Judge Kehoe delivered his instructions to the jury carefully, reading a prepared statement that had been previously submitted for comment to counsel for each party.” In reality, the judge had explicitly told the jurors that Hunt was a “public figure” and that they must find “actual malice” in order to find the Spotlight guilty of libel. Indeed, before producing a verdict, the jury asked to review the testimony of Victor Marchetti, the author who wrote the story about Hunt, Spotlight publisher Willis Carto, and Managing Editor James Tucker. None of these men testified, as Lorenz did, of knowing anything about a conspiracy, but their testimony was relevant to the issue of whether the article was published with “malice.” Conclusion Plausible Denial is thus an artfully crafted exercise in withholding evidence from readers. Lane withholds the names and testimony of several of Hunt’s alibi witnesses, the credibility problems of Marita Lorenz, and the fact that the verdict hinged not on whether Hunt was an assassination conspirator, but rather whether the article met a narrow legal definition of “malice.” Unlike most conspiracy books, which pepper readers with factoids, Lane seems to be very careful to avoid saying things that are provably untrue. Rather, by the careful withholding of evidence and the calculated spinning of the evidence he actually presents, he makes his case. And unlike most conspiracy authors, he seems to actually know what he’s doing. ● Ed Dolan and Jean Davison provided valuable information that aided the writing of this article.

Joan Mellen's Book "A Farewell to Justice" Trades in Garrison Mythology A Farewell to History: Hello Mythology A Farewell to Justice: Jim Garrison, JFK’s Assassination, and the Case That Should Have Changed History , by Joan Mellen (Potomac Books; November 2005) Review by Patricia Lambert Joan Mellen reviewed unfavorably my 1999 book, False Witness, and in the book being reviewed here she is critical of my work. Despite the promise implicit in its subtitle, A Farewell to Justice does not try to explain what happened in Dallas when President Kennedy was shot in 1963 but rather to justify what happened in New Orleans years later, when District Attorney Jim Garrison put a businessman named Clay Shaw on trial for conspiracy to murder the president. Garrison was legally discredited if not humiliated, twice: in 1969, when a jury deliberated only 54 minutes before setting Shaw free, and again in 1971, when a federal court concluded that Garrison’s prosecution of Shaw was based on shockingly insubstantial, even concocted, evidence. By “building upon Garrison’s effort” (as the author’s web page says), this book is an attempt to resuscitate the evidentiary equivalent of a corpse. The author embraces questionable witnesses and unlikely stories with little to recommend them except that they fit with her (and Garrison’s) belief that the CIA killed John F. Kennedy. Literary Body Snatching One such witness is Jack Martin, an important figure in Mellen’s story and, at least in the beginning, in Garrison’s. An occasional private investigator, Jack was a former mental patient and alcoholic whose conspiracy stories first surfaced in 1963 when they were investigated and found to be binge-induced fantasies. Even Garrison once called Jack “a liar.” Mellen transforms this courthouse hanger-on (known for his intrinsic unreliability) into a savvy CIA operative who “never left the agency,” an all-knowing insider and sinister conspirator, by giving him a new identity—that of a Washington, D.C., man working for the CIA. The author embraces questionable witnesses and unlikely stories with little to recommend them except that they fit with her (and Garrison’s) belief that the CIA killed John F. Kennedy. She engineers this literary version of body snatching largely by incorrectly reporting the results of a 1967 inquiry, conducted by the CIA, into the possibility that a former agency employee named Joseph James Martin and a John J. Martin (one of Jack’s aliases) might be the same individual. The investigation found that the two men were not the same. Yet Mellen, with no explanation, concludes the opposite—that they were the same and, while oddly insisting that Jack’s real name was John J. Martin, she proceeds to reconstruct Jack’s life using Joseph’s biography. This, despite the fact that the two were born in different states, two years apart, and that Joseph died in 1975 while Jack was very much alive. Moreover, Jack’s real name was not Jack, John J., or Joseph. It was Edward Stewart Suggs, as his FBI files show. Phantom Loan Consider too this allegation regarding David Ferrie, a pilot posthumously named by Garrison as one of Clay Shaw’s two co-conspirators (the other being Lee Harvey Oswald). The week of the assassination, supposedly needing money to rent a plane, Ferrie supposedly signed a $400 loan document and Clay Shaw supposedly co-signed it. In one of those stunning extrapolations that mark this work, Mellen declares: “The document proved not only that Ferrie and Shaw knew each other, but that they participated together in preparations for the assassination, reflecting their mutual foreknowledge of the crime.” What does Mellen have to prove this document existed? Not the document, not even an author’s interview with the alleged lender. What she has is a single witness who claims he spoke to the lender and saw the contract thirty-five years earlier. Moreover, the reader is supposed to believe that the same CIA which sponsored the assassination couldn’t scrape together $400 in cash so Ferrie and Shaw would not leave behind a paper trail. Thomas Edward Beckham: Scam Artist The best single example of the curious nature of this book concerns Thomas Edward Beckham, an amiable scam artist and person of interest to Garrison, who told a 1968 grand jury he knew nothing about the crime. Nevertheless, by 1977 he had a “300-page manuscript about the assassination,” his attorney at that time told a reporter, but hadn't “been able to get it published.” He did, however, briefly snare the attention of the House Committee re-investigating the assassination. “Beckham, alias Eggleston Zimmerman,” had just been acquitted of federal fraud charges (for allegedly promoting “a country music concert that was never held”) when he was first interviewed by committee investigators. Later, he told his story under oath. Beckham claimed he and Oswald (“the nicest guy I ever met”) were “good buddies”; that he attended a meeting in New Orleans where killing the president was discussed; and, subsequently, delivered a package to Dallas and a suitcase of money to Miami. After taking his deposition, the committee quickly lost interest. . . . the reader is supposed to believe that the same CIA which sponsored the assassination couldn’t scrape together $400 in cash so Ferrie and Shaw would not leave behind a paper trail. Beckham was schooled only through the third grade and spent time in mental institutions on at least three occasions. (Mellen claims the latter was a CIA setup, but Beckham’s deposition suggests otherwise.) In 1992 he had changed his name some eight times, according to writer Gus Russo, who tracked him down at his home in Louisville, Kentucky, and recently recalled the encounter. Beckham basically acknowledged to me being what most people would call a flimflam artist—I remember he pointed to his office walls. They were filled with bogus diplomas from every major university; he was selling them and cheap trinkets, like whoopee cushions, for a living. . . He told me he not only recorded but wrote three Number One hits, which he named—“From a Jack to a King” was one. When I told him that I was a former professional musician and recited the names of the real composers, he laughed and said, “Well, I can’t fool you.” . . . For anyone to use him as a source for anything is staggering. In Mellen’s view, it was the president’s assassination that set Beckham on the “wandering life of a con man.” But Beckham was conning people before then: In 1962 he was “wearing a Roman collar” and “soliciting money” as a Catholic priest (for “Cuban revolutionary forces,” according to him). In the book’s dramatic finale, Mellen describes “a government document,” given to her by Beckham, on “United States Army Air Defense Command” letterhead allegedly recounting the training Beckham received in 1963 at Camp Peary, “the CIA training installation. . .also known as The Farm.” There, Mellen says, he was “taught how to be an assassin.” Then she states the following: This revelatory and never-before-seen document reveals how military intelligence, the Army, and the CIA, working in concert, had set up a scapegoat [in case Oswald was unavailable]….His being groomed at the CIA for that role places the murder of the president at the highest levels of intelligence. Beckham’s experience demonstrates that Oswald certainly did not plan the assassination of President Kennedy, nor did he operate at any time “alone” just as Jim Garrison had claimed all along. Those grandiose conclusions are based on an unauthenticated document, absurd on its face, provided by a man with a long history of using phony documents. Beckham, who later in life, Mellen writes, “studied to be a Rabbi,” is a crucial witness in this book. The final chapter is devoted mostly to him and closes with his endorsement of Garrison: “He got it where it started and no one else came close. . . I wish I could have told him.” That the author thinks Thomas Beckham, with his spy stories and “government document,” advances her cause, is revealing of her but tells the reader nothing whatever about the Kennedy assassination. A Farewell to Justice is not an easy read. The book’s epic-size cast sometimes renders the narrative incoherent. New characters appear at a dizzying rate, vast numbers of whom are said to be CIA connected—CIA operatives, CIA media assets, CIA agents, CIA employees. Affixing the CIA label to as many lapels as possible (regardless of how flimsy the evidence), appears to be a central goal of this book, the assumption being that no such association could possibly be innocent or, God forbid, patriotically inspired.

Affixing the CIA label to as many lapels as possible (regardless of how flimsy the evidence), appears to be a central goal of this book. . . Clay Shaw’s alleged intelligence career supposedly began during World War II when he served in the SOS, which Mellen identifies as the “Special Operations Section,” “an Army counterintelligence group.” She provides no evidence for this and for good reason—she is grossly mistaken. Shaw served in the United States Army’s Services of Supply in the European Campaign under Brig. Gen. Charles O. Thrasher, who ran its huge daily operations. Shaw was Thrasher’s “right hand man.” The job of that SOS was to keep allied forces equipped with everything from “toothpaste to tanks” as they fought their way to Germany. Shaw, who began as Thrasher’s aide-de-camp and became his deputy chief of staff, later said that supplying three armies as they spread out across Europe honed his “organizational skills.” A definition of SOS chosen because it fits an agenda is worse than meaningless, it is fiction. For facts, readers might want to look elsewhere. November 16, 2005 Unless otherwise indicated, these documents are found in the JFK Collection at the National Archives in College Park, Maryland.

Eisenhower's Farewell Address to the Nation Eisenhower's Farewell Address to the Nation January 17, 1961 G ood evening, my fellow Americans: First, I should like to express my gratitude to the radio and television networks for the opportunity they have given me over the years to bring reports and messages to our nation. My special thanks go to them for the opportunity of addressing you this evening. Three days from now, after a half century of service of our country, I shall lay down the responsibilities of office as, in traditional and solemn ceremony, the authority of the Presidency is vested in my successor. This evening I come to you with a message of leave-taking and farewell, and to share a few final thoughts with you, my countrymen. Like every other citizen, I wish the new President, and all who will labor with him, Godspeed. I pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all. Our people expect their President and the Congress to find essential agreement on questions of great moment, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of the nation. My own relations with Congress, which began on a remote and tenuous basis when, long ago, a member of the Senate appointed me to West Point, have since ranged to the intimate during the war and immediate post-war period, and finally to the mutually interdependent during these past eight years. In this final relationship, the Congress and the Administration have, on most vital issues, cooperated well, to serve the nation well rather than mere partisanship, and so have assured that the business of the nation should go forward. So my official relationship with Congress ends in a feeling on my part, of gratitude that we have been able to do so much together. We now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations. Three of these involved our own country. Despite these holocausts America is today the strongest, the most influential and most productive nation in the world. Understandably proud of this pre-eminence, we yet realize that America's leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment. Throughout America's adventure in free government, such basic purposes have been to keep the peace; to foster progress in human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity and integrity among peoples and among nations. To strive for less would be unworthy of a free and religious people. Any failure traceable to arrogance or our lack of comprehension or readiness to sacrifice would inflict upon us a grievous hurt, both at home and abroad. Progress toward these noble goals is persistently threatened by the conflict now engulfing the world. It commands our whole attention, absorbs our very beings. We face a hostile ideology global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose, and insidious in method. Unhappily the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration. To meet it successfully, there is called for, not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis, but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily, surely, and without complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle – with liberty the stake. Only thus shall we remain, despite every provocation, on our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment. Crises there will continue to be. In meeting them, whether foreign or domestic, great or small, there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulties. A huge increase in the newer elements of our defenses; development of unrealistic programs to cure every ill in agriculture; a dramatic expansion in basic and applied research – these and many other possibilities, each possibly promising in itself, may be suggested as the only way to the road we wish to travel. A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction. But each proposal must be weighed in light of a broader consideration; the need to maintain balance in and among national programs – balance between the private and the public economy, balance between the cost and hoped for advantages – balance between the clearly necessary and the comfortably desirable; balance between our essential requirements as a nation and the duties imposed by the nation upon the individual; balance between the actions of the moment and the national welfare of the future. Good judgment seeks balance and progress; lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration. The record of many decades stands as proof that our people and their Government have, in the main, understood these truths and have responded to them well in the face of threat and stress. But threats, new in kind or degree, constantly arise. Of these, I mention two only. A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction. Our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime, or indeed by the fighting men of World War II or Korea. Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States corporations. A merican makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence – economic, political, even spiritual – is felt in every city, every Statehouse, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together. Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades. In this revolution, research has become central, it also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly. A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the Federal government. Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers. The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present – and is gravely to be regarded. Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite. T he prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present – and is gravely to be regarded. It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic system – ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society. Another factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time. As we peer into society's future, we – you and I, and our government – must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering for, for our own ease and convenience, the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without asking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow. Down the long lane of the history yet to be written America knows that this world of ours, ever growing smaller, must avoid becoming a community of dreadful fear and hate, and be, instead, a proud confederation of mutual trust and respect. Such a confederation must be one of equals. The weakest must come to the conference table with the same confidence as do we, protected as we are by our moral, economic, and military strength. That table, though scarred by many past frustrations, cannot be abandoned for the certain agony of the battlefield. Disarmament, with mutual honor and confidence, is a continuing imperative. Together we must learn how to compose differences, not with arms, but with intellect and decent purpose. Because this need is so sharp and apparent I confess that I lay down my official responsibilities in this field with a definite sense of disappointment. As one who has witnessed the horror and the lingering sadness of war – as one who knows that another war could utterly destroy this civilization which has been so slowly and painfully built over thousands of years – I wish I could say tonight that a lasting peace is in sight. Happily, I can say that war has been avoided. Steady progress toward our ultimate goal has been made. But, so much remains to be done. As a private citizen, I shall never cease to do what little I can to help the world advance along that road. So – in this my last good night to you as your President – I thank you for the many opportunities you have given me for public service in war and peace. I trust that in that service you find some things worthy; as for the rest of it, I know you will find ways to improve performance in the future. You and I – my fellow citizens – need to be strong in our faith that all nations, under God, will reach the goal of peace with justice. May we be ever unswerving in devotion to principle, confident but humble with power, diligent in pursuit of the Nations' great goals. To all the peoples of the world, I once more give expression to America's prayerful and continuing aspiration: We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations, may have their great human needs satisfied; that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full; that all who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings; that those who have freedom will understand, also, its heavy responsibilities; that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity; that the scourges of poverty, disease and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth, and that, in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love. Now, on Friday noon, I am to become a private citizen. I am proud to do so. I look forward to it. Thank you, and good night. S o was Ike a 60s leftist like Oliver Stone? Note some key elements of Ike's thinking: Eisenhower didn't believe the Military Industrial Complex was to blame for the Cold War. He laid the blame on communism: "a hostile ideology global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose, and insidious in method." Eisenhower felt the Military Industrial Complex was necessary. Eisenhower felt the influence of the Military Industrial Complex might be "sought or unsought." For 60s leftists, "unsought" power for the Military Industrial Complex was inconceivable. A principled Republican, Ike was also skeptical of agricultural and research programs fostered by the federal government. He did not consider military industrial interests uniquely insidious, but rather he distrusted government expansion generally. Return to Kennedy Assassination Home Page

Joseph Milteer -- Foreknowledge of the JFK Assassination? Joseph Milteer: Miami Prophet, or Quitman Crackpot? T he fellow at the right is named Joseph Milteer. He looks benign enough, but in fact he had some very nasty political opinions and some very nasty friends. These political opinions and these friends are the reason many conspiracists think he had "foreknowledge" of the Kennedy assassination. Milteer was a political activist in far-right, racist circles from Quitman, Georgia. He was independently wealthy, and traveled constantly. On one of his trips, to Miami, he made statements about Kennedy being killed. In Crossfire Jim Marrs reports that: On November 9, 1963, a Miami police informant named William Somersett met with Joseph A. Milteer, a wealthy right-wing extremist who promptly began to outline the assassination of President Kennedy. Milteer was a leader of the arch-conservative National States Rights Party as well as a member of other groups such as the Congress of Freedom and the White Citizen's Council of Atlanta. Somersett had infiltrated the States Rights Party and secretly recorded Milteer's conversation. The tape, later turned over to Miami police, recorded Milteer as saying, "[During Kennedy's impending visit to Miami] You can bet your bottom dollar he is going to have a lot to say about the Cubans, there are so many of them here . . . The more bodyguards he has, the easier it is to get him . . . From an office building with a high-powered rifle . . . He's knows he's a marked man." (p. 265) For this, Jim Marrs calls him "The Miami Prophet." Was he that? Or was he just a racist blowhard? If you read Marrs' account, you might be inclined to believe that he knew something. But even in the account Marrs provides, it's interesting that Milteer says nothing about "triangulation of crossfire," or a "kill zone" or multiple shooters. If Milteer had any "foreknowledge" he had foreknowledge of a single shooter. Anthony Summers' book Conspiracy deals with Milteer in two places. In the text he recounts the following edited version of Milteer's conversation with Somersett (p. 404): INFORMANT: I think Kennedy is coming here on the 18th, or something like that to make some kind of speech . . . EXTREMIST: You can bet your bottom dollar he is going to have a lot to say about the Cubans. There are so many of them here. INFORMANT: Yeah. Well, he will have a thousand bodyguards, don't worry about that. EXTREMIST: The more bodyguards he has the easier it is to get him. INFORMANT: Well, how in the hell do you figure would be the best way to get him? EXTREMIST: From an office building with a high-powered rifle. . . He knows he's a marked man . . . . INFORMANT: They are really going to try to kill him? EXTREMIST: Oh yeah, it is in the working . . . . INFORMANT: Boy, if that Kennedy gets shot, we have to know where we are at. Because you know that will be a real shake if they do that. EXTREMIST: They wouldn't leave any stone unturned there, no way. They will pick somebody up within hours afterwards, if anything like that would happen. Just to throw the public off. Then, in a long footnote (p. 624), Summers adds the following: Joseph Milteer, the right-wing extremist who said two weeks before the assassination that the President's murder was "in the working," told a police informant afterward that "Everything ran true to form. I guess you thought I was kidding you when I said he would be killed from a window with a high-powered rifle." Asked whether he was guessing when he made the original remark, Milteer replied, "I don't do any guessing." According to the informant, Milteer said there was no need "to worry about Lee Harvey Oswald getting caught because he doesn't know anything." The right wing, said Milteer, was "in the clear," adding that "the patriots have outsmarted the Communist group in order that the Communists would carry out the plan without the right wing becoming involved." Again, note that Milteer takes "credit" for knowing that Kennedy was going to be "killed from a window with a high-powered rifle." This is the Warren Commission's version of what happened. More to the point, it was the version that law enforcement officials and the media were publicizing when Milteer talked to Somersett. Rather than having "inside knowledge" that the media were pushing an inaccurate account, Milteer accepts what law enforcement officials and the media were saying! He does seem to accept that Oswald is a "patsy" that has been manipulated. But he says a "communist group" was manipulated by "the patriots" (presumably, Milteer's racist buddies) to do the killing. Does anybody believe it happened this way? But while a careful reading of Summers and Marrs will make one doubt that Milteer actually had any "inside knowledge" of a conspiracy to kill Kennedy, it's the stuff that these authors suppress that is the most damning. A more complete account of what Milteer told Somersett is found in an article in the September 1976 issue of Miami Magazine by Dan Christensen. Titled "JFK, King: The Dade County Links" it provides details omitted from conspiracy books. Somersett: ...I think Kennedy is coming here on the 18th...to make some kind of speech...I imagine it will be on TV. Milteer: You can bet your bottom dollar he is going to have a lot to say about the Cubans. There are so many of them here. Somersett: Yeah, well, he will have a thousand bodyguards. Don't worry about that. Milteer: The more bodyguards he has the easier it is to get him. Somersett: Well, how in the hell do you figure would be the best way to get him? Milteer: From an office building with a high-powered rifle. How many people does he have going around who look just like him? Do you now about that? Somersett: No, I never heard he had anybody. Milteer: He has about fifteen. Whenever he goes anyplace, he knows he is a marked man. Somersett: You think he knows he is a marked man? Milteer: Sure he does. Somersett: They are really going to try to kill him? Milteer: Oh yeah, it is in the working. Brown himself, [Jack] Brown is just as likely to get him as anybody in the world. He hasn't said so, but he tried to get Martin Luther King. After a few more minutes of conversation, Somersett again spoke of assassination. Somersett: Hitting this Kennedy is going to be a hard proposition, I tell you. I believe you may have figured out a way to get him, the office building and all that. I don't know how the Secret Service agents cover all them office buildings everywhere he is going. Do you know whether they do that or not? Milteer: Well, if they have any suspicion they do that, of course. But without suspicion, chances are that they wouldn't. You take there in Washington. This is the wrong time of the year, but in pleasant weather, he comes out of the veranda and somebody could be in a hotel room across the way and pick him off just like that. Somersett: Is that right? Milteer: Sure, disassemble a gun. You don't have to take a gun up there, you can take it up in pieces. All those guns come knock down. You can take them apart. Before the end of the tape, the conversation returns to Kennedy. Milteer: Well, we are going to have to get nasty... Somersett: Yeah, get nasty. Milteer: We have got to be ready, we have got to be sitting on go, too. Somersett: Yeah, that is right. Milteer: There ain't any count-down to it, we have just go to be sitting on go. Countdown, they can move in on you, and on go they can't. Countdown is all right for a slow prepared operation. But in an emergency operation, you have got to be sitting on go. Somersett: Boy if that Kennedy gets shot, we have got to know where we are at. Because you know that will be a real shake... Milteer: They wouldn't leave any stone unturned there. No way. They will pick somebody within hours afterwards, if anything like that would happen, just to throw the public off. Somersett: Oh, somebody is going to have to go to jail, if he gets killed. Milteer: Just like Bruno Hauptmann in the Lindbergh case, you know. It seems the conspiracy books leave some things out. They usually don't tell readers about: The 15 look-alikes that Kennedy has travelling with him? If you're going to shoot Kennedy, you wouldn't want to hit one a' them look-alikes, would you? The fact that Milteer named the man who was supposedly going to kill Kennedy — one Jack Brown — and nobody has linked him to the assassination. Interestingly, after the assassination, Brown was forgotten. The fact that the language about taking a disassembled gun up into a tall building was in the context of shooting Kennedy on the veranda of the White House, in warm weather. It seems that presenting Milteer as "The Miami Prophet" (Marrs' term for him) rather than "The Quitman Crackpot" requires withholding information from your readers. A Generic Scenario Had JFK been killed by some bizarre or exotic means — poison in his breakfast cereal or a hand grenade thrown into the presidential limo — and Milteer had described that, his statements might be impressive. But in fact he described the most generic possible assassination scenario. He was far from the only person who did. Dallas Secret Service chief Forest Sorrels was questioned by the Warren Commission about planning for the Dallas motorcade: Mr. STERN. When you laid out the motorcade route and drove over it — and I take it you drove over it several times — Mr. SORRELS. Yes, sir. Mr. STERN. Did you consider or discuss with Mr. Lawson the possibility of any danger to the President from the buildings along the route? Mr. SORRELS. Well — Mr. STERN. Did you think about any of the buildings as presenting any particular problem? Mr. SORRELS. All buildings are a problem, as far as we are concerned. That, insofar as I have been concerned — and I am sure that every member of the Service, especially the Detail — that is always of concern to us. We always consider it a hazard. During the time that we were making this survey with the police, I made the remark that if someone wanted to get the President of the United States, he could do it with a high-powered rifle and a telescopic sight from some building or some hillside, because that has always been a concern to us, about the buildings. (7H338) Sorrels was not the only person who thought about this. Presidential aide Kenneth O'Donnell recounted to the Warren Commission a conversation that took place in Fort Worth on the very morning of the assassination: Mr. O'DONNELL. Well, as near as I can recollect he [JFK] was commenting to his wife on the function of the Secret Service and his interpretation of their role once the trip had commenced, in that their main function was to protect him from crowds, and to see that an unruly or sometimes an overexcited crowd did not generate into a riot, at which the President of the United States could be injured. But he said that if anybody really wanted to shoot the President of the United States, it was not a very difficult job — all one had to do was get a high building some day with a telescopic rifle, and there was nothing anybody could do to defend against such an attempt on the President's life. (7H456) So did JFK have "foreknowledge" of his own assassination? Vindicating Milteer: the "Cancelled Motorcade" in Miami But Milteer's importance is inflated, in the conspiracy book accounts, by the supposed fact that the Kennedy's "Miami motorcade" was cancelled because of Milteer's statements. Marrs claims: Captain Charles Sapp, head of Miami's Police Intelligence Bureau, was concerned enough with Milteer's remarks to alert both the FBI and the Secret Service. Again, apparently no word of this right-wing plot reached Secret Service agents involved in Kennedy's Dallas trip. Sapp in later years, however, recalled that plans for a Miami motorcade were scrapped and the President instead flew to a scheduled speech by helicopter. (p. 265) And Summers notes that: While the Assassinations Committee found no reference in the documentary record, it has been reported that there was a last-minute change in the Miami program. Captain Sapp recalls that a planned motorcade was cancelled — for fear of trouble from the anti-Castro movement. On arriving at Miami Airport late in the day, the President flew by helicopter to and from his speech-making at the Americana Hotel. (p. 405) Summers is vague and apparently evasive about what the House Select Committee found. In fact, anyone reading their Report should note the following: A Miami journalist later reported that a decision was made to transport President Kennedy from Miami International Airport to a Miami Beach hotel by helicopter to avoid exposing him to assassins by having him ride in a motorcade. The committee could find no documentation for this report. (p. 230) For the article written by the Miami journalist [claiming the motorcade was cancelled], see Christensen, Dan, "JFK, King: The Dade County Links," in Miami Magazine , September 1976, p. 25 (JFK Document 003360). Christensen could not document his assertion therein that a planned motorcade was canceled, other than to say that "many people" believed that a cancellation had taken place; see outside contact report with Dan Christensen, Feb. 2, 1978, House Select Committee on Assassinations (JFK Document 004434). Persons cited by Christensen as sources for corroboration of his version of the cancellation did not recall that his version was correct; see outside contact report with the Honorable Seymour Gelber, Feb. 2, 1978, House Select Committee on Assassinations (JFK Document 005533); outside contact report with Attorney Richard Gerstein, Feb. 2, 1978, House Select Committee on Assassinations (JFK Document 013458): interview of Miami field office Special Agent Talmadge Bailey, Mar. 1, 1978, House Select Committee on Assassinations, pp. 5-7 (JFK Document 009385): and interview of Miami field office Special Agent Robert J. Jamison, Feb. 28, 1978, House Select Committee on Assassinations, p. 2 (JFK Document 007063). (p. 635) So Christensen, who wrote the otherwise fine article quoted above, began a factoid that has been endlessly repeated in the JFK conspiracy books. The House Select Committee seemed unaware that a couple of years earlier the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (Church Committee) had studied this issue. On January 9, 1976 the Church Committee sent a letter of inquiry to the Department of the Treasury, outlining the basic "Milteer" story, and noting that "We are also generally aware that President Kennedy visited Miami, Florida on November 18, 1963, and that a scheduled motorcade through downtown Miami was cancelled." The Committee went on to request "A detailed explanation as to why the President's Miami motorcade was cancelled, including a statement as to whether there was any relationship between the cancellation and Milteer's threat." An official response came from James T. Burke, Assistant Director of the Secret Service (Protective Intelligence). There is no evidence in Service files to indicate a presidential motorcade was planned for the Miami visit. The survey reports indicate helicopter travel was planned from Miami International Airport to Bal Harbor and a motorcade was to be utilized only in case of inclement weather. The Secret Service advance agents for this visit both recall that helicopter travel was planned from the beginning of their survey on 11-11-63. There is no basis for the insinuation that helicopter travel was planned as a result of the Milteer threat. (Source: National Archives documents: 121-10002-10063 and 121-10002-10064) More recent research has made it even clearer that no motorcade was cancelled. Researcher Gordon Winslow found a memo dated November 1, 1963 (over a week before Milteer's statements), from William Jibb (Administrative Assistant to Senator George Smathers) to Dick Pettigrew (a Florida political operative) outlining the confidential itinerary for Kennedy's trip to Tampa and Miami. Since Smathers was a Democratic senator from Florida, his staff was heavily involved in planning the trip. Winslow found this in the Smathers collection at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Gordon Winslow's web site, Cuban Information Archives , is an excellent source for information on Cuban exiles, and goings-on in Miami. The schedule has Kennedy arriving at Miami at 5:00 p.m. for a rally at the Miami International Airport. Then at 5:30 it says "Departs from Miami International Airport by helicopter for Americana Hotel on Miami Beach." No motorcade mentioned. Thus the "cancelled motorcade" factoid, which was debunked in 1976, is being repeated in conspiracy books two decades later (and counting). One can see why. Inflating the importance of Milteer lends credibility to the notion that he actually knew something about a forthcoming assassination — rather than being merely an extremist given to wild talk. And it allows conspiracy book writers to imply that it was somehow sinister that information about Milteer was not passed along to the Dallas Secret Service — in spite of the fact that Milteer never said anything about a threat to Kennedy in Dallas. More on the "Cancelled Motorcade" If conspiracy books should have long since quit repeating the factoid about the "cancelled motorcade," the issue turns out to be a bit more complicated. Researcher John Fiorentino has established that there was a motorcade in Miami. In fact, there was both a helicopter trip from the airport and a motorcade along a few blocks in downtown Miami, as shown on this aerial photo which Fiorentino has supplied . Indeed, Fiorentino has found a photo from this motorcade . Although Kennedy indeed departed for the Americana via air, his helicopter actually landed at Haulover Beach Park heliport. From there the President departed by automobile to the Americana. Here is the President's itinerary beginning at 5:30 p.m. 5:30 p.m. President left speakers' stand and, after shaking hands with many in the general public area and guests in the VIP section, boarded helicopter. 5:35 p.m. Helicopter departed airport. 5:45 p.m. Helicopter arrived heliport, Haulover Beach Park. 5:48 p.m. President departed helicopter by automobile. The presidential car, a Mercury convertible on arrival, and a Continental hardtop on departure, was driven by SA Greer. The Secret Service follow-up car, a Ford convertible, was driven by SA Rybka. What do we make of this apparently conflicting evidence? Quite simply, as the William Jibb memo proves, a helicopter trip was planned from the beginning. Apparently, in the thinking of people making the plans, the helicopter was taking Kennedy to the "Americana Hotel on Miami Beach," since the chopper landed as close to the hotel as it could. So the conspiracy books are wrong on two counts. The helicopter trip was planned from well before Milteer spouted off to Somersett. And the motorcade (brief as it was) was never called off. Vindicating Milteer: Call from Dallas on the Day of the Assassination But yet another claim about Milteer would provide compelling evidence that Milteer had foreknowledge of the assassination. He supposedly called Somersett from Dallas on the morning of November 22 nd , and predicted that Kennedy would be killed. According to Marrs: On the day of the assassination, Milteer telephoned Somersett, saying he was in Dallas and that Kennedy was due there shortly. Milteer commented that Kennedy would never be seen in Miami again. ( Crossfire , p. 265) Groden and Livingstone, in High Treason (Baltimore: The Conservatory Press, 1989, p. 408) assert: At 10:30 A.M. on November 22, Somersett received a phone call in Miami from Milteer in Dallas, stating that President Kennedy would be there that day and would not be visiting Miami again. And Henry Hurt, in Reasonable Doubt (New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1985, p. 411) claims: On November 22, Milteer telephoned his "friend," the informant and told him he was in Dallas. Prior to the midday events, Milteer told the informant that Kennedy was expected in Dallas that day and would probably never again visit Miami. Damning. But is it true? Photo of Milteer in Dealey Plaza? One piece of evidence offered to support the presence of Milteer in Dallas is a blow-up from a photo by James Altgens of the presidential limo on Houston Street, just seconds before the turn on Elm. The photo is shown below, with an arrow pointing to the "Milteer" figure. Robert Groden, in The Killing of a President , shows his readers the photo, and then claims: Milteer stood on Houston Street, next to eyewitnesses Carolyn Walther and Pearl Springer. While the crowd about him called out greetings to the President, Milteer stood silently, his right arm held up at a 90 degree angle. Then the first shots were fired. As pandemonium erupted in the Plaza, Milteer quietly disappeared into the crowds. (p. 196) The House Select Committee was aware of the "Milteer" figure, and put its panel of photographic experts to work on it. The panel was unconvinced. First, they pointed out two facial features that clearly differentiated the spectator on Houston Street and Milteer. All of the available Milteer photographs show the membranous portion of Milteer's upper lip was very thin. The enhanced photographs of the spectator suggest a rather full and thick upper lip. This is not a trait apt to be influenced by normal variation in facial expression. In the earliest photographs Milteer has a full, regular hairline with no central or lateral retreat suggestive of incipient baldness. In the photograph that was apparently taken when Milteer was about 55 years old, his hairline is virtually identical to that of the earlier photographs. The latest photograph, taken about a decade after the assassination, shows Milteer with a full head of hair. The spectator, however, appears to have little, if any, hair. The extent of the balding, though, could not be ascertained; no hairline is visible, and in fact, the entire frontal crown of the head appears bare. But the height of the spectator provided even more conclusive evidence: The only available height record of Milteer gives his stature as 64 inches. This corresponds to about the seventh statural percentile of American males. That is, about 93 out of 100 adult American men would be taller than Milteer. Also, about 35 percent of adult American females would exceed Milteer's reported height. In contrast, the spectator alleged to be Milteer is taller than 4 of the 7 other males and all of the 16 females in the line of spectators shown in the motorcade photograph. Based upon Milteer's reported height, the probability of randomly selecting a group of Americans where so many are shorter than Milteer's reported height is .0000007. Moreover, an analysis based upon actual measurements of certain physical features shown in the photograph yields a height estimate for the spectator of about 70 inches — 6 inches taller than Milteer's reported stature. (HSCA Volume 6, pp. 242-257) In short: the spectator wasn't Milteer. He didn't even particularly look like Milteer. Somersett's Account So Willie Somersett's account is the only evidence of Milteer being in Dallas on the day of the assassination. Unlike the November 9 conversation, which was taped by Somersett, we have only Somersett's word for Milteer's "call from Dallas." And interestingly, his earliest accounts don't mention any such call. Consider for example a transcript of an interview he had with the Miami Police Department just four days after the assassination. MIAMI POLICE INFORMANT INFORMATION ON MILTEER November 26, 1963 PAGE 4 [....] Q: Do you know whether this Milteer has ever spent any time in New Orleans? A: He said that he had been to New Orleans and that he had been to Dallas Texas. This probably would have been 5-6 months ago, he didn't specify a certain time, but he was in New Orleans, Dallas, and Gulfport Mississippi, and in Biloxi, Mississippi and in Jackson, and he spent quite a time in Alabama. [....] Q: Do you have any idea of your own thought, what is your thought, do you think maybe Milteer could have been in Dallas, Texas in the last two weeks? A: Yes, he could have been there, I am satisfied that he could have been most anywhere he wanted; he has two cars ready to move at anytime. Q: You have seen no evidence that he was there? A: No. He didn't say that he was, the only thing he said that he had been in Texas. PAGE 7 Q: He didn't say when he had been in Texas? A. No, he didn't say. He had been in New Orleans, Houston, different places in Louisiana and in Texas. Not only does Somersett fail to mention the "phone call from Dallas," he fails to mention it in the precise context of whether Milteer had been in Texas. Milteer's conversation with Somersett included some wild and some very nasty statements , but not that particular one. The "Milteer called from Dallas story" seems to have originated in Somersett's conversations with Jim Garrison's cockamamie investigation . It can be found in "MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION BETWEEN [BUD] FENSTERWALD AND BILL SOMERSETT" from the New Orleans District Attorney's office. It's National Archives document 180-10099-10133. Dated June 5, 1968, it's the first known instance of Somersett mentioning this supposed incident. Somersett had some other interesting things to say in this interview. For example: Milterr's [sic] account of the shooting in Dallas is that Ruby shot from the Mall and that Tippett [sic] shot from the top of a building. A good guess is that this was the Daltex Building. Milterr [sic] was not clear about Oswald's role although he thought he was downstairs in the book depository rather than on an upper floor. Somersett guesses that it might have been Milterr [sic] himself that fired the shots from the windows of the book depository. Somersett appears, by this time, to have become rather a buff! While it's difficult to disentangle Milteer's crackpot notions from things added by Somersett, one gets the clear impression that Somersett is "improving" on Milteer's account a bit. Certainly the "phone call on the morning of the assassination" seems to be a Somersett addition to the story, with no basis in fact. Further, Somersett's silly scenario with multiple shooters differs from Milteer's recorded account which had only a single gunman in a tall building. How reliable was Somersett? Not surprisingly, authorities who had been receiving information from Somersett were becoming skeptical. A Secret Service memorandum of March 10, 1967, describes some of the things Somersett claimed to have heard from Milteer, and notes: The informant, William Somersett (CO-2-43,860), who has furnished information in a number of cases involving Presidential interest, has been described as overenthusiastic, prone to exaggeration, and mentally unstable. This is National Archives document 180-10091-10212. But even in 1963, Federal authorities considered Somersett a rather suspect informant. It is true that a November 27, 1963 FBI letterhead memorandum describes Somersett as "a source who has furnished reliable information in the past, and in addition has furnished some information that could not be verified or corroborated . . . " (Record Number 124-10008-10267). However, an FBI memorandum from Rosen to Belmont written on the same day says: It should be noted that Somersett was discontinued as an informant in 1961 for indiscretions on his part which threatened to expose a reliable Bureau informant and that Somersett is regarded as a "professional informant" who is in the business of furnishing information primarily for monetary gains. [...] In connection with the investigation of the Birmingham bombings, Somersett furnished information bordering on the fantastic, which investigation failed to corroborate. (Archives Record Number 124-10012-10306) Thus conspiracy authors have been ill-advised indeed to accept the "phone call from Dallas" on Somersett's uncorroborated testimony. But it gets worse. There is solid evidence Milteer wasn't in Dallas. The following is a report from the United States Secret Service — Atlanta office, dated 11/27/63. SYNOPSIS Check on potentially dangerous persons November 22-25, 1963. All accounted for. PRS so advised. DETAILS OF INVESTIGATION Immediately after learning of the President's assassination at Dallas we began ascertaining the whereabouts of known subjects who might be suspected. Capt. R.E. Little, Intelligence Division, Atlanta Police Department, had seen J. B. Stoner in Atlanta one hour before the assassination. He is, we feel, the most likely of the group to do something drastic. FBI Agent Charles Harding contacted their agent at Thomasville who immediately ascertained that J.A. Milteer was in Quitman at the time of the assassination. We also learned that Lee McCloud was in Atlanta. Herbert Wallace Butterworth, according to FBI Agent Harding, was in Philadelphia at the time and was under surveillance. They continued surveillance until after the funeral on November 25. Olga Butterworth, sister of Wallace, was at her home in Wallingford, Pennsylvania. Inspector Torina called me on November 24 — and a little later SA Holmes from PRS — requesting that we review files and advise if any dangerous subject might appear in Washington. I informed them of our previous check. (National Archives document 180-10091-10198) Several other documents reiterate the finding that Milteer was in Quitman. For example, an FBI memorandum from Rosen to Belmont written on November 27, 1963 says: Atlanta has advised that investigation indicates there is no truth in the information furnished by Somersett and that Milteer was in Quitman, Georgia, on 11/22/63. (Archives Record Number 124-10012-10306) The day before, an "Urgent" teletype from SAC Atlanta to "Director" [Hoover] and the SACs in Birmingham and Dallas said: J. A. MILTEER RESIDE [sic] QUITMAN, GA. INVESTIGATION HAS INDICATED MILTEER WAS IN QUITMAN ON NOV. TWENTYTW [sic] TWO, SIXTYTHREE. (Archives Document Number 124-10012-10384) Conclusion Rather than having any "foreknowledge" of the assassination, Milteer gave a generic assassination scenario virtually identical to one that John Kennedy himself articulated. Mixed in were wacky elements that conspiracy books conceal from their readers. No Miami motorcade was cancelled because of his ranting, and he was not in Dallas on the day of the assassination. Given Milteer's extreme right-wing politics and his hobnobbing with potentially violent types, it's tempting to believe that he must have "gotten wind" of some real assassination plot. The problem is that there just isn't any evidence of it. The "Milteer story" has been known for over 30 years, and researchers have been unable to connect him or his associates to any of the "usual suspects" in the assassination — the CIA, anti-Castro Cubans, Texas millionaires, defense contractors. He was "connected" to the FBI alright. They were spying on him. Although Milteer's rag-tag racist associates were capable of violence, they lacked the technical expertise to pull off an elaborate assassination plot. And they lacked the friends in high places that would have been necessary to pull off a "coverup" of a killing they did. By 1967 the Secret Service decided that Milteer was not dangerous nor a security risk . He was, quite simply, a crackpot who shot off his mouth and in doing so gained an entirely unmerited place in Kennedy assassination conspiracy books.

Kennedy Assassination: Changed Motorcade Route? Changed Motorcade Route in Dallas? Y ou'll find it discussed in most conspiracy books, and most especially in Jim Garrison's book, On the Trail of the Assassins (right). Supposedly, John Kennedy's motorcade through Dallas, which was to go directly down Main Street and onto the Stemmons Freeway, was changed at the last minute to turn of Houston Street, and then Elm Street. Why is this supposed to be sinister? Because the route down Elm Street takes the limo near the Grassy Knoll, where a shooter was supposedly stationed. It also takes the motorcade near other buildings (such as the Dal-Tex) were shooters could be hidden, supposedly creating a "triangulation of crossfire." Below is a drawing of the "originally planned" parade route, and the "revised" parade route -- taken from On the Trail of the Assassins is shown below. Garrison's Account of His "Discovery" Jim Garrison, the New Orleans District Attorney who prosecuted Clay Shaw for conspiring to murder Kennedy, claimed to have discovered the "changed route." He says that, during his investigation of the assassination in 1967: The temporary respite from the investigation did not last long. Frank Klein could not stay away from it, and neither could I. One morning I was in my office reading and rereading a newspaper. I did not hear Frank enter. "I have never seen you so preoccupied," said Frank. "It's not just any paper, son," I said. "This is the front page of the Dallas Morning News for November 22, 1963." "Well, what's got you so hypnotized?" I gestured to the large diagram on the paper's front page, indicating the route of the presidential parade. "Have I ever shown you this before?" I asked. He shook his head. I turned the paper around facing his way so that he could read the diagram of the motorcade. It covered almost five-sixth of the front page. "Frank," I said, "I want you to follow the parade route with me. Let's pick it up right here as it comes down Main approaching Dealey Plaza. Are you with me?" "Yes," he said, his finger following the thick line indicating the motorcade. "And here is where it reaches Dealey Plaza . . . " He stopped. "What's the matter?" I asked. "This diagram indicates that the President's parade was supposed to continue on Main Street through the center of Dealey Plaza -- without even leaving Main." He stared at it in disbelief. "So what's wrong with that?" I asked. His finger was moving off of Main, inches downward to Elm until he found the Depository area where the President had been shot. "If that was the presidential parade route up there on Main . . . " I finished the question for him. "How did he get way down here on Elm?" Frank looked up at me with a slight frown, then looked back at the diagram. He moved his finger back along Main Street to where it reached Houston. "The motorcade turned right on Houston and went down onto Elm," he said. . . . "Here on Main Street, continuing through the open meadow," he said, "they couldn't have hit him. Are you telling me that at the last moment they just moved the President of the United States off of his scheduled route to here where the Depository is?" He pushed back his chair and stood up. "Hell, I haven't read a damned word about that anywhere. How can they keep something like that a secret for three years?" [...] Frank grabbed the front page of the Dallas Morning News and pointed to the diagram. "Hell," he said, "was the Warren Commission blind? Didn't they see this?" "Oh," I said. "Would you like to see the front page that was introduced to the Warren Commission?" I pulled open my middle desk drawer and took out a copy of the Dallas Morning News front page that had been introduced as a Commission exhibit. I handed it to Frank and lit my pipe. I had hardly taken the first puff on it when he yelled. "Those bastards! They just removed the entire motorcade route from the front page." That was true. On five-sixths of the Dallas Morning News page where the diagram of the motorcade route was supposed to be was nothing but a large square of solid gray. "And this has been printed as an official exhibit by the Warren Commission?" he asked. I noded. "And just what in the hell are we supposed to call this?" he asked, waving the nearly blank exhibit. I took a puff or two on my pipe. "This is what you call," I replied, "a coup d'etat." On the Trail of the Assassins , pp. 101-103. So the very sage, very perceptive Garrison caught the Warren Commission in a "coverup" of a key piece of evidence. According to Garrison. What did that map in the Dallas Morning News look like? It is shown at right. And indeed, it does show the motorcade proceeding from Main Street in Dallas to the Trade Mart with no turn onto Elm Street. But what about Garrison's claim that the map took up "five-sixths of the front page" of the Dallas Morning News ? Take a look at the front page that showed the map . The reason for no turn being shown should be easy to figure out: the scale of the map was too small. The preceeding evening, the Dallas Times-Herald ran a much larger map of the motorcade route. See what it shows . In fact, printed descriptions of the motorcade route had been printed in both the Dallas papers on Tuesday, November 19th. Here is the description in the Dallas Morning News. Here is the description in the Dallas Times-Herald. I t seems that the "changed motorcade route" is a factoid. It never happened. Evidence was wrenched out of context, and misinterpreted. Ironically, anyone who had read the Warren Commission Report would have known the truth. That volume discussed the parade route extensively (see below). It made it clear that you have to turn on Houston and then Elm to get from Dallas' Main Street to the Stemmons Freeway. If you try driving down Main, you can get to the Stemmons only by driving over a concrete divider strip. That would be illegal, absurdly undignified for the presidential limo, and impossible for the press busses that were a part of the motorcade. A Garrison Discovery? In spite of Garrison's claim to have discovered this "changed parade route," this particular factoid had long since been publicized. Apparently, it was a "discovery" of Joachim Joesten, whose book Oswald: Assassin Or Fall Guy? was published in 1964, before the Warren Commission Report was issued. In fact, the Commission was aware of Joesten, and probably put so much effort into dedunking the "changed parade route" claim because of him. But might Garrison have discovered the "changed parade route" independently, in just the way he claimed? There is one huge problem with this idea. Garrison said: I turned the paper around facing his way so that he could read the diagram of the motorcade. It covered almost five-sixth of the front page. And again: That was true. On five-sixths of the Dallas Morning News page where the diagram of the motorcade route was supposed to be was nothing but a large square of solid gray. "And this has been printed as an official exhibit by the Warren Commission?" he asked. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Garrison never saw that front page . Like so much else from the Garrison "investigation" this was picked up from the conspiracy buffs who flooded into New Orleans when the District Attorney announced his inquiry. It's a Trap! G arrison, who probably believed the "changed motorcade route" story, could hardly know that he was setting a trap for unwary "witnesses" who would, in the future, tell interesting tales about a conspiracy killing Kennedy. The story spread, was repeated in several conspiracy books, and began to circulate among conspiracy-oriented "researchers." Then witnesses began to come forward claiming to have personal knowledge of the "changed motorcade route." Jean Hill , who now says she saw a shooter on the Grassy Knoll, claimed in her book, The Last Dissenting Witness , that her boyfriend "J.B. Marshall," a Dallas Police officer, told her about the change. Supposedly Lyndon Johnson's agents gave the instructions to change the route at Love Field on the morning of the assassination. James Files , who now claims to have been the Grassy Knoll shooter, says that on the morning of the assassination he went to a pancake house with mobster Johnny Roselli. Jack Ruby then came in and gave Roselli an envelope containing Secret Service identification and a map of the motorcade route. The map showed a "change" in the route: a "zig-zag, that little turn they should never have made . . . ." People who believe in the "changed motorcade route" naturally eat this stuff up. It "confirms" what they have read in conspiracy books. But what are we to think of these witnesses if we know that the route was never changed? Conspiracy book authors uniformly claim to have read the Warren Commission Report . But on issue after issue they show that they have not. It's not a matter of their reading the Report and not believing it. On a matter like this, they could easily check out the evidence and confirm that the Report told the truth. Both news stories from November 19th mentioning the turn onto Elm, for example, were printed in the Warren Commission volumes. The following is the account of the selection of the motorcade route, taken from the Warren Commission Report . Planning the Texas Trip President Kennedy's visit to Texas in November 1963 had been under consideration for almost a year before it occurred. He had made only a few brief visits to the State since the 1960 Presidential campaign and in 1962 he began to consider a formal visit. . . . The basic decision on the November trip to Texas was made at a meeting of President Kennedy, Vice President Johnson, and Governor Connally on June 5, 1963, at the Cortez Hotel in El Paso, Tex. The President had spoken earlier that day at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo., and had stopped in El Paso to discuss the proposed visit and other matters with the Vice President and the Governor. The three agreed that the President would come to Texas in late November 1963. The original plan called for the President to spend only 1 day in the State, making whirlwind visits to Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, and Houston. In September, the White House decided to permit further visits by the President and extended the trip to run from the afternoon of November 21 through the evening of Friday, November 22. When Governor Connally called at the White House on October 4 to discuss the details of the visit, it was agreed that the planning of events in Texas would be left largely to the Governor. At the White House, Kenneth O'Donnell, special assistant to the President, acted as coordinator for the trip. Everyone agreed that, if there was sufficient time, a motorcade through downtown Dallas would be the best way for the people to see their President. . . . According to [Kenneth] O'Donnell, "we had a motorcade wherever we went," particularly in large cities where the purpose was to let the President be seen by as many people as possible. In his experience, "it would be automatic" for the Secret Service to arrange a route which would, within the time allotted, bring the President "through an area which exposes him to the greatest number of people." Advance Preparations for the Dallas Trip Advance preparations for President Kennedy's visit to Dallas were primarily the responsibility of two Secret Service agents: Special Agent Winston G. Lawson, a member of the White House detail who acted as the advance agent, and Forrest V. Sorrels, special agent in charge of the Dallas office. Both agents were advised of the trip on November 4. Lawson received a tentative schedule of the Texas trip on November 8 from Roy H. Kellerman, assistant special agent in charge of the White House detail, who was the Secret. Service official responsible for the entire Texas journey. As advance agent working closely with Sorrels, Lawson had responsibility for arranging the timetable for the President's visit to Dallas and coordinating local activities with the White House staff, the organizations directly concerned with the visit, and local law enforcement officials. . . . The Luncheon Site An important purpose of the President's visit to Dallas was to speak at a luncheon given by business and civic leaders. The White House staff informed the Secret Service that the President would arrive and depart from Dallas' Love Field; that a motorcade through the downtown area of Dallas to the luncheon site should be arranged; and that following the luncheon the President would return to the airport by the most direct route. Accordingly, it was important to determine the luncheon site as quickly as possible, so that security could be established at the site and the motorcade route selected. . . . Kenneth O'Donnell made the final decision to hold the luncheon at the Trade Mart; [Gerald] Behn [Secret Service Agent in Charge of the White House detail] so notified Lawson on November 14. The Motorcade Route A lthough accurate, the Warren Commission "official version" downplays some of the political maneuvering that accompanied Kennedy's trip to Dallas, and his schedule there. Joel Grant discusses these in his essay "The Three Furies." Rather than the sinister hand of a conspiracy, we see ordinary politics. On November 8, when Lawson was briefed on the itinerary for the trip to Dallas, he was told that 45 minutes had been allotted for a motorcade procession from Love Field to the luncheon site. Lawson was not specifically instructed to select the parade route, but he understood that this was one of his functions. Even before the Trade Mart had been definitely selected, Lawson and Sorrels began to consider the best motorcade route from Love Field to the Trade Mart. On November 14, Lawson and Sorrels attended a meeting at Love Field and on their return to Dallas drove over the route which Sorrels believed best suited for the proposed motorcade. This route, eventually selected for the motorcade from the airport to the Trade Mart, measured 10 miles and could be driven easily within the allotted 45 minutes. From Love Field the route passed through a portion of suburban Dallas, through the downtown area along Main Street and then to the Trade Mart via Stemmons Freeway. For the President's return to Love Field following the luncheon, the agents selected the most direct route, which was approximately 4 miles. After the selection of the Trade Mart as the luncheon site, Lawson and Sorrels met with Dallas Chief of Police Jesse E. Curry, Assistant Chief Charles Batchelor, Deputy Chief N. T. Fisher, and several other command officers to discuss details of the motorcade and possible routes. The route was further reviewed by Lawson and Sorrels with Assistant Chief Batchelor and members of the local host committee on November 15. The police officials agreed that the route recommended by Sorrels was the proper one and did not express a belief that any other route might be better. On November 18, Sorrels and Lawson drove over the selected route with Batchelor and other police officers, verifying that it could be traversed within 45 minutes. Representatives of the local host committee and the White House staff were advised by the Secret Service of the actual route on the afternoon of November 18. The route impressed the agents as a natural and desirable one. Sorrels, who had participated in Presidential protection assignments in Dallas since a visit by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936,as testified that the traditional parade route in Dallas was along Main Street, since the tall buildings along the street gave more people an opportunity to participate. The route chosen from the airport to Main Street was the normal one, except where Harwood Street was selected as the means of access to Main Street in preference to a short stretch of the Central Expressway, which presented a minor safety hazard and could not accommodate spectators as conveniently as Harwood Street. According to Lawson, the chosen route seemed to be the best. It afforded us wide strees most of the way, because of the buses that were in the motorcade. It afforded us a chance to have alternative routes if something happened on the motorcade route. It was the type of suburban area a good part of the way where the crowds would be able to be controlled for a great distance, and we figured that the largest crowds would be downtown, which they were, and that the wide streets that we would use downtown would be of sufficient width to keep the public out of our way. Elm Street, parallel to Main Street and one block north, was not used for the main portion of the downtown part of the motorcade because Main Street offered better vantage points for spectators. To reach the Trade Mart from Main Street the agents decided to use the Stemmons Freeway (Route No. 77), the most direct route. The only practical way for westbound traffic on Main Street to reach the northbound lanes of the Stemmons Freeway is via Elm Street, which Route No. 77 traffic is instructed to follow in this part of the city. Elm Street was to be reached from Main by turning right at Houston, going one block north and then turning left onto Elm. On this last portion of the journey, only 5 minutes from the Trade Mart, the President's motorcade would pass the Texas School Book Depository Building on the northwest corner of Houston and Elm Streets. . . . The Elm Street approach to the Stemmons Freeway is necessary in order to avoid the traffic hazards which would otherwise exist if right turns were permitted from both Main and Elm into the freeway. To create this traffic pattern, a concrete barrier between Main and Elm Streets presents an obstacle to a right turn from Main across Elm to the access road to Stemmons Freeway and the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike. This concrete barrier extends far enough beyond the access road to make it impracticable for vehicles to turn right from Main directly to the access road. A sign located on this barrier instructs Main Street traffic not to make any turns. In conformity with these arrangements, traffic proceeding west on Main is directed to turn right at Houston in order to reach the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike, which has the same access road from Elm Street as does the Stemmons Freeway. As the date for the President's visit approached, the two Dallas newspapers carried several reports of his motorcade route. The selection of the Trade Mart as the possible site for the luncheon first appeared in the Dallas Times-Herald on November 15, 1963. The following day, the newspaper reported that the Presidential party "apparently will loop through the downtown area, probably on Main Street, en route from Dallas Love Field" on its way to the Trade Mart. On November 19, the Times-Herald afternoon paper detailed the precise route: From the airport, the President's party will proceed to Mockingbird Lane to Lemmon and then to Turtle Creek, turning south to Cedar Springs. The motorcade will then pass through downtown on Harwood and then west on Main, turning back to Elm at Houston and then out Stemmons Freeway to the Trade Mart. Also on November 19, the Morning News reported that the President's motorcade would travel from Love Field along specified streets, then "Harwood to Main, Main to Houston, Houston to Elm, Elm under the Triple Underpass to Stemmons Freeway, and on to the Trade Mart." On November 20 a front page story reported that the streets on which the Presidential motorcade would travel included "Main and Stemmons Freeway." On the morning of the President's arrival, the Morning News noted that the motorcade would travel through downtown Dallas onto the Stemmons Freeway, and reported that "the motorcade will move slowly so that crowds can 'get a good view' of President Kennedy and his wife."

No finding of neurological impairment or psychotic mental changes could be made. Lee has to be diagnosed as "personality pattern disturbance with schizoid features and passive--aggressive tendencies."

Lee's Lies Lee's Lies By Brian Dautch Lee Harvey Oswald was, throughout his life, a liar. He consistently deceived, manipulated, and hoodwinked, with varying degrees of success. The web of deception wove its way through not only strangers and acquaintances, but friends and loved ones as well. In the final analysis, it becomes apparent that Lee Harvey Oswald lied to nearly every person with whom he shared any meaningful encounter, and that the lies are perhaps as strong a testament as any to the path which led him to his ultimate demise. To understand that Oswald was a liar is not to necessarily say that he was a lone nut assassin. His frequent lies, many to government agencies like the State Department and the FBI, might have marked him as a plausible patsy. And his scheming and conniving might suggest that he was the sort who could be manipulated -- hoodwinked, turned into a patsy -- by people who were much more competent schemers and liars than Lee Oswald. Oswald, born in 1939, had begun his term of enlistment in the Marine Corps on October 26, 1956, at the tender young age of 17. (1) A trivial fact on the surface, perhaps, but meaningful in terms of the chain of events set off by his military stint; many, including his half brother John Pic and his full brother Robert Oswald, presumed that Lee was attempting to get out from under the "yoke of oppression" of their mother. (2) Marguerite Oswald raised Lee alone, since his father had died suddenly, and did not provide for their food and clothing as well as she could have, and was exceedingly controlling. (3) It was not the first time Oswald would significantly alter his surroundings to escape persecution, real or imagined. In fact, it was this very same driving force which led Oswald to Russia, where he met his future wife, Marina Prusakova. Lee and Marina Oswald told Marina a series of lies well before they were married. Almost immediately, he told her he was 24 years old, the same age as another suitor of Marina's, so she wouldn't think he was young and immature. (4) Knowing Marina's family would not want her to leave Russia for America, Lee told Marina and her relatives that he couldn't get back into America even if he wanted to, having permanently defected. In reality, Lee had not fully renounced his citizenship from the United States because he failed to fill out all the official paperwork necessary for complete expatriation, so returning to the U.S. would hardly be problematic for either of them, especially since they were to be married before going to America. (5) To garner her sympathy, he also claimed to Marina that his mother was dead. (6) In fact, not only was Marguerite Oswald still quite alive at the time, she outlived Oswald himself by several years. This third falsehood held special significance, because later Lee lied again to his wife about the circumstances of his dislike for his mother. Rather than explain his past to the woman who loved him, he merely brushed her off by stating that the only reason behind his anger toward his mother was that he didn't like Marguerite's treatment of Robert's wife, mentioning nothing of the difficult childhood he endured under her harsh rule. (7) In sum, Lee was forced to tell a lie to cover up an earlier lie, and the initial components of Oswald's web of deception had been established. Lee's "Historic Diary" Among Oswald's possessions originating in Russia was something he called his "Historic Diary," an account of the time he spent in that country. The use of the phrase "diary" is a misnomer, however, since Oswald did not write up the accounts contained in its twelve pages until long after the dates he wrote on each page. (8) The Warren Commission noticed a number of anachronisms in the document, since some entries referred to events which had not yet occurred. Also, the exceedingly melodramatic tone (and title) of the diary indicated that Oswald was attempting to spice up the events to hold the interest of future readers. For instance, the diary asserts that Oswald was offered citizenship in the Soviet Union, but he refused; similarly, it states that he was asked to address a meeting of workers in Minsk, and that he humbly declined that proposal as well. (9) Lee and Marina in Dallas Upon arriving in Dallas with Marina, Oswald had a chance to begin anew, with an utterly clean slate. His wife apparently felt no need to hold Lee's lies against him, since she was forced to rely upon him for everything. Marina could not speak English, and Lee was in no rush to help her learn. (10) Rather than deal honestly with some of the new people he met in Texas, Lee chose to continue his untruthful ways. This is the point in Lee's life when he began to tell a certain type of lie: the type which was absolutely needless and unnecessary. After returning to the United States, Lee seemed to lie at least as much out of habit as of necessity, to the point where it struck people other than Marina that Lee appeared to simply enjoy lying for the opportunity to conceal. (11) In Dallas, Oswald met a man named George Bouhe, who helped him get settled in the new town, and may even have tided him over with occasional monetary supplements. (12) Asking Lee to keep in touch, Bouhe assumed that Lee would provide him with occasional updates of his whereabouts and employment situation. Instead, Lee would only call Bouhe from a pay phone every few days, mutter "I'm doing fine" into the phone, and hang up. When the befuddled Bouhe finally asked Oswald where he was staying, Oswald told him he was at the Carlton Boarding House in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas. In truth, Oswald had never been there at all. (13) Later, Oswald would use Bouhe and others as references for job applications without their knowledge, and would usually provide the potential employer with inaccurate addresses for such acquaintances. (14) Lee and Marina's infant daughter, June, became sick and had to be taken to (of all places) Parkland Memorial Hospital, where President Kennedy was taken after being fatally wounded. Lee felt he would be unable to pay the bill, and consequently told an incredible series of lies to try to avoid paying for June's treatment (which consisted only of brief examinations for the baby's fever of 103 degrees). He lied about his address, said he was not employed (he was, at an advertising photography firm called Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall, making as much as $1.50 per hour for a forty-hour work week), and that he did not receive unemployment compensation of any kind. (15) Finally, Lee received, and paid, a bill for only two dollars. (16) At this point, Lee's lies had now included his wife, those who tried to befriend him, and hospital personnel who only wanted to help improve the health of his only daughter. The web of deception was growing ever larger. Oswald purchased two firearms in the year 1963, both of which would be implicated in the Kennedy Assassination and the subsequent murder of Dallas Police Officer J.D. Tippit. In ordering the firearms, he lied about two major pieces of information, one of which did not seem to present Oswald with an advantage of any kind. When purchasing the rifle, he lied about his name, citing it as "A. Hidell" on the money order when sending away for the gun on March 12, 1963 to Klein's Sporting Goods in Chicago for the total sum of $21.45. (17) Hidell, which rhymes with the name of Oswald's political hero "Fidel," was the fictitious name of the only member of Oswald's Fair Play for Cuba Committee. (18) Prior to this, when purchasing the .38 special Smith and Wesson revolver cited as the murder weapon against Officer Tippit, he claimed his age was 28, when in fact he was 23 at the time. It was not necessary for Oswald to tell this lie, since at the age of 23 he was easily old enough to purchase a gun, and revealing his actual age to Klein's would not have been problematic in the least. (19) Lee as Political Activist Speaking of the aforementioned Fair Play for Cuba Committee, the information provided to pedestrians walking the streets of New Orleans also contained a number of less than truthful statements. First of all, the pamphlet, distributed in early June 1963, contained the name "A.J. Hidell," Oswald's alternate identity (rhyming with "Fidel," as mentioned earlier). Oswald would also have Marina sign the name "Hidell", who was "President" of the New Orleans Chapter of the F.P.C.C., on Oswald's so-called membership card. (20) Secondly, the pamphlet stated that "lectures" would be included in Committee Activities, although he would undoubtedly have been the only person doing any "lecturing." (21) Finally, the pamphlet by its nature, mentioning prominently the "New Orleans Charter Member Branch," clearly implied that the organization was quite large, when in truth Oswald was its one and only member. Now, Oswald's web of deception was growing to include people he did not even know. Oswald was not reluctant to lie to the United States government, including statements he made to Agent Louis Quigley of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). While being held on the charge of disturbing the peace, Oswald asked to speak to an FBI agent, who turned out to be Quigley. Oswald told Agent Quigley about some very basic personal information which the Bureau knew to be false. (22) For example, Oswald lied about Marina's maiden name, claiming it was "Prossa" and claimed to have been married to her in Fort Worth, TX. When these comments are taken in combination with Oswald's reticence on the topic of the F.P.C.C. and its specific details in talking with Quigley, the interview essentially boiled down to Oswald requesting permission to talk to the FBI purely so he could lie to them. Lee's "Revolutionary Resume" Later in the summer of 1963, Oswald spent a good deal of time preparing, for the New York School for Marxist Study, a resume of his life and many of the activities it had (or had not) included. Often referred to as the "Revolutionary Resume" (for reasons I will discuss momentarily), it spoke of time he spent as a "Radio Speaker and Lecturer" (he was once soundly routed in a radio debate in New Orleans), his "Street Agitation" (a reference to the time he handed out the F.P.C.C. documents in New Orleans, for which he was arrested and soon released after a charge of disturbing the peace was filed), an "Organizer" (meaning, presumably, the one-man New Orleans Chapter of the F.P.C.C. itself), a "Photographer" (meaning the time he spend working at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall), a "Marxist," "Defector," and "Resident of U.S.S.R." (23) Later, Oswald took this resume to Mexico City, hoping to impress the Cuban Embassy with the qualifications it represented. Oswald wanted to gain entry to Cuba in order to fight for the man he often called "Uncle Fidel." (24) On October 14, 1963, Oswald rented an eight-by-twelve foot room at 1026 North Beckley Street, in Dallas' Oak Cliff neighborhood, using the name O.H. Lee. At this point, Oswald was lying to virtually anyone who asked what his name was, including the landlady and manager at this particular boarding house, Gladys Johnson. (25) This is the house to which Oswald fled after the assassination, before the slaying of Officer Tippit. Not long after visiting this, his last residence, Oswald was lying yet again. Lee in Custody Oswald was questioned about his involvement in both cases between the afternoon of November 22 and the morning of November 24. Although many of the notes from the interrogation were destroyed, some of Oswald's statements were made on the record. Among them were claims that he purchased the revolver in Fort Worth, that he did not receive any packages addressed to "Hidell," at his P.O. Box, such as that which contained the rifle, and that he did not in fact, own a rifle at all. (26) When it was discovered that Oswald was not telling the truth with regard to any of these claims, the lies finally caught up to Oswald--the police and FBI refused to believe much of anything he said. Now, he had nowhere left to turn, no place left to run, no one left to deceive. Lee Harvey Oswald's years of lies had finally caught up to him. Everything he had gotten away with had come full circle, and he was seemingly paying all at once for a lifetime of deceit. Had Oswald trapped himself because, when his penultimate scheme (to get into Cuba) failed and his life was "spinning out of control" (Gerald Posner's term) he resorted in desperation to the one final act that would give him the place in history he believed he deserved? Or was Oswald's love of spy games, aliases, and false fronts turned against him by people vastly better at that sort of thing than he was? Regardless, it is hard to avoid the feeling that Lee Harvey Oswald's web of deceit wound up ensnaring him. 1. MacMillan, Priscilla, Marina and Lee , Harper and Row, New York, 1977, p. 62. 2. Ibid. 3.

Lee Oswald: Played the Victim Game in the Wake of the JFK assassination Playing the Victim "I'm Just a Patsy" LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION! Question: "Did you shoot the President?" Answer: No, they've taken me in because of the fact that I lived in the Soviet Union...I'M JUST A PATSY!" Was he? Or was Oswald playing the victim game for the press? It seems to me if we examine other incidents of Oswald's life, we see other events that are very similar to his "patsy" comment that serve as a means to manipulate others into thinking that he was being treated unfairly. His aborted suicide attempt in the Soviet Union can be seen as Oswald feeling victimized by the Soviet bureaucracy's refusal to allow him to extend his tourist visa. So what does he do? Writes a dramatic entry in his "Historic Diary" and slashes his left wrist, knowing full well that his Intourist Guide was to meet him that evening at his hotel. People that are serious about committing suicide generally insure that there act will not be discovered and that the means used would bring on a quick death. Keeping that in mind, I see Oswald's suicide attempt as nothing more than a manipulative act to stay in Russia. If he was truly serious about ending his life he would have slashed both his arms in an upward fashion. One bleeds to death quite quickly in this case. Instead he slashes one wrist and is discovered by his Intourist guide when he doesn't show up in the hotel lobby where he was supposed to meet her. Playing the victim work well for Oswald in this case because the KGB shipped him off to Minsk so as to avoid a possible international incident in the event he tried again...... While at the Soviet Consulate in Mexico City he tells three KGB officers that the FBI has threatened his life and was responsible for his unemployment. He brandishes a pistol during this meeting saying he needs it to protect himself from the FBI, and then in the course of this meeting sobs, "I am afraid...they'll kill me. Let me in!" ( Passport to Assassination , page 77) Playing the victim this time doesn't work out for Oswald because he is denied entry into Cuba... Immediately following his arrest at the Texas Theater he exclaims that his civil rights are being violated and that he is a victim of police brutality. He asks the arresting officers, "Why are you doing this to me?," "I want my lawyer, I know my rights." Playing the victim after killing a policeman and attempting to kill another while in the Theater doesn't get him too far... And that takes us back to his patsy statement to the press...which he says in reference to his having lived in the Soviet Union. In other words, Oswald is saying that if he hadn't lived in the USSR he wouldn't have been picked up by the police but since he did he's being singled out unfairly and set up...more of the victim game. Does he tell his wife, brother or the authorities that he is a patsy or that he was set up?...no, because he didn't have an audience that might feel he is being victimized simply because he lived in the Soviet Union. If you have other video clips of Oswald being moved from Fritz's office on the third floor to the lineups downstairs, you'll hear more "poor me" statements. Such as "I don't know what this is all about," etc. Of course in his interrogation he lies and is blatantly arrogant to the authorities. But that's not the Oswald we see when he is in front of TV cameras and hordes of reporters. We see Oswald attempting once again to be the poor victim of circumstances. I'm just a patsy, indeed!

Lee Harvey Oswald -- Orphan Lee Harvey Oswald: Orphan Failed Remarriage Destroys Hope For Father Figure The following is from pages 669-674 of the Warren Commission Report . In August 1929, while . . . working at the law firm, Marguerite married Edward John Pic, Jr.,10 a quiet man of her own age, who worked as a clerk for T. Smith & Son. a New Orleans stevedoring company. The marriage was not a success, and by the summer of 1931 she and Pic were separated. Marguerite was then 3 months pregnant; she told her family that Pic did not want any children and refused to support her. Pic ascribed the separation simply to their inability to get along together. A boy was born on January 17, 1932, whom Marguerite named John Edward Pic. Pic saw his son occasionally until he was about 1 year old; after that, he did not see the boy again but contributed to his support until he was 18 years old. During her separation from her first husband, Marguerite saw a great deal of Robert Edward Lee Oswald, an insurance premium collector, who also was married but was separated from his wife. In 1933, Marguerite was divorced from Pic and, Oswald's wife also having obtained a divorce, they were married in a Lutheran church on July 20. Marguerite has described the period of her marriage to Oswald as "the only happy part" of her life. A son was born on April 7, 1934, who was named for his father; Oswald wanted to adopt John Pic, but his mother objected on the ground that John's father might cut off the support payments. In 1938, the Oswalds purchased a new house on Alvar Street for $3,900,26 in what John remembered as "a rather nice neighborhood." The house was across the street from the William Frantz School, which first John and later both he and Robert, Jr., attended. On August 19, 1939, little more than a year after the Oswalds bought the Alvar Street house, Robert Oswald died suddenly of a heart attack. Two months later, on October 18, 1939, a second son was born. He was named Lee after his father; Harvey was his paternal grandmother's maiden name. [ . . . ] In July 1943, Mrs. Oswald was hired to manage a small hosiery store. This is probably the store to which she referred in her testimony as the "Princess Hosiery Shop on Canal Street," at which, she testified, she was left by herself and "in 6 days' time * * * hired four girls." Her employer remembers her as a neat, attractive, and hardworking woman, an aggressive person who would make a good manager. She was not good with figures, however, and after several months he discharged her. At about this same time, she met Edwin A. Ekdahl, an electrical engineer older than herself, who was originally from Boston but was then working in the area. They saw each other often. Ekdahl met the boys and, according to John's testimony, on at least one occasion, they all spent a weekend at a summer resort area in Covington, La. Marguerite Oswald with husband Edwin A. Ekdahl. The failure of their marriage deprived Lee Oswald of a father figure. By January 1944, Mrs. Oswald and Ekdahl had decided to marry. She withdrew Lee from the Children's Home and moved with him to Dallas, where Ekdahl expected to be located. They planned to postpone the marriage until the end of the school year so that the older boys could complete the year at the home before they left it. In the meantime, she would care for Ekdahl, who was recovering from a serious illness, probably a heart attack. Mrs. Oswald has testified that when she arrived in Dallas, she decided that she did not want to marry Ekdahl after all. Using part of the proceeds from the sale of the Alvar Street house, she purchased a house at 4801 Victor Street, a portion of which she rented. In June, John and Robert left the Children's Home and joined their mother in Dallas. They entered the nearby Davy Crockett Elementary School the following September. Ekdahl visited Mrs. Oswald on weekends and stayed at Victor Street. By the following year she had resolved her doubts about marrying him, influenced in part by his substantial income and perhaps by the visit some time earlier of his sister, who favored the marriage because of his ill health. Explaining that she expected to travel a great deal, Mrs. Oswald tried unsuccessfully to return the older boys to the home in February 1945. She and Ekdahl were married in May. After a brief honeymoon, they returned to Victor Street. Ekdahl got along well with the boys, on whom he lavished much attention. John testified that Ekdahl treated them as if they were his own children and that Lee seemed to find in Ekdahl "the father he never had"; John recalled that on one occasion he told Lee that Ekdahl and his mother had become reconciled after a separation, and that "this seemed to really elate Lee, this made him really happy that they were getting back together." Because Ekdahl's business required him to make frequent trips, in September, John and Robert were placed in the Chamberlain-Hunt Military Academy at Port Gibson, Miss.; their mother paid the tuition herself, using the proceeds from the sale of the Alvar Street property. They remained at the academy for the next 3 years, returning home only for or vacations. Lee accompanied his parents on their travels. Mrs. Myrtle Evans, who had known both Marguerite and Ekdahl before their marriage, testified that Marguerite insisted on keeping Lee with her; Mrs. Evans thought that Marguerite was "too close" to Lee and "spoiled him to death," which hurt her marriage to Ekdahl. Sometime in the fall after John and Robert were at boarding school, the Ekdahls moved to Benbrook, a suburb of Fort Worth, where they lived on Granbury Road, in a house of stone or brick, set on a large plot of land. Records of the Benbrook Common School show Lee's admission into the first grade on October 31; his birth date is incorrectly given as July 9, 1939, his mother presumably having given that date to satisfy the age requirement. . . . The Ekdahls' marriage quickly broke down. Before they had been married a year, Marguerite suspected Ekdahl of infidelity. She thought him stingy, and there were frequent arguments about his insistence that she account for her expenditures and his refusal to share his money with her. In the summer of 1946, she left Ekdahl, picked up John and Robert at Chamberlain-Hunt, and moved with the boys to Covington, La., where they lived for at least part of the time at 311 Vermont Street. Mrs. Evans described them at Covington, possibly during this summer, as "really a happy family"; Lee seemed like a normal boy but "kept to himself" and seemed not "to want to be with any other children." The separation continued after the two boys returned to boarding school, and in September Lee was enrolled in the Covington Elementary School. His record at Benbrook had been satisfactory he was present on 82 school days and absent on 15, and received all A's and B's -- but he had not completed the work of the first grade, in which he was enrolled for a second time. Lee received no grades at the Covington School, from which he was withdrawn on January 23, 1947, because his parents, now reconciled, were moving to Fort Worth, where they lived at 1505 Eighth Avenue. Four days later, he enrolled in the Clayton Public School; he was still in the first grade, which he completed in May with B's in every subject except physical education and health, in which he received A's. In the fall, he entered the second grade in the same school but, relations between his parents having deteriorated again, was withdrawn before any grades were recorded. After the move to Fort Worth, the Ekdahls continued to argue frequently; according to John, "they would have a fight about every other day and he would leave and come back." That summer, Marguerite obtained what she regarded as proof that Ekdahl was having some sort of affair. According to her testimony, a neighbor told her that Ekdahl had been living on Eighth Avenue with another woman while she was in Covington. Then, at a time when Ekdahl was supposed to be out of town, she went with John and several of his friends to an apartment in Fort Worth; one of the boys posed as a telegram carrier, and when the door opened she pushed her way into the apartment and found Ekdahl in his shirt sleeves in the company of a woman in a negligee. Despite this apparent confirmation of her suspicions, Marguerite continued to live with Ekdahl until January 1948. In January, according to Ekdahl's allegations in the subsequent divorce proceedings, she "directed * * * [him] to leave the home immediately and never to return," which he did. Ekdahl filed suit for divorce in March. The complaint alleged that Marguerite constantly nagged Ekdahl and argued "with reference to money matters," accused him of infidelity, threw things at him, and finally ordered him out of the house; that these acts were unprovoked by Ekdahl's conduct toward her; that her acts endangered his already impaired health; and that her "excesses, harsh and cruel treatment and outrages" toward him made it impossible for them to live together. She denied all these allegations. After a trial, at which John testified and, he thought, Lee was called to the stand but was excused without testifying, the jury found on special issues that Marguerite was "guilty of excesses, cruel treatment, or outrages" unprovoked by Ekdahl's conduct. June 24, the court granted the divorce and approved an agreement between the parties disposing of their property between them and awarding Marguerite $1,500; at her request, the divorce restored to Marguerite her former name, Marguerite C. Oswald. You may wish to see: The main Lee Harvey Oswald page . The "Oswald Timeline" showing the schools he attended and residences where he lived as a child and youth.

JFK Assassination: Photogrammetry: How it Matters How Photogrammetry Matters The following is from Volume II of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, page 427. Mr. MCCAMY. Suppose that we have a rifle for which the midpoint is known, and suppose we have a camera. The two elements shown are the lens and the film. Point A on one end of the rifle is imaged by the lens at A-prime. Point B at the center is imaged at B-prime. Point C at the other end is imaged at C-prime. These two lengths on the rifle are equal. They are 14 inches each. So, from A to B is equal to B to C. However, when they are imaged over here, A-prime to B-prime is only 1-1/2 inches, while B-prime to C-prime is 4 inches. Mr. FITHIAN. Is what? Mr. MCCAMY. Four inches. Mr. FITHIAN. Four inches. Mr. MCCAMY. So, you can see that because the rifle is tilted away from the camera, the size of the images changes over here. This is a very known phenomenon in photogrammetry. Return to Kennedy Assassination Home Page

Jack Ruby Mobster, Intelligence Agent, or Small-time Hustler? B etween 1949 and November 24, 1963, Ruby was arrested eight times by the Dallas Police Department. The dates, charges, and dispositions of these arrests are as follows: February 4, 1949, Ruby paid a $10 fine for disturbing the peace. July 26, 1953, Ruby was suspected of carrying a concealed weapon; however, no charges were filed and Ruby was released on the same day. May 1, 1954, Ruby was arrested for allegedly carrying a concealed weapon and violating a peace bond; again no charges were filed and Ruby was released on the same day. December 5, 1954, Ruby was arrested for allegedly violating State liquor laws by selling liquor after hours; the complaint was dismissed on February 8, 1955. June 21, 1959, Ruby was arrested for allegedly permitting dancing after hours; the complaint was dismissed on July 8, 1959. August 21, 1960, Ruby was again arrested for allegedly permitting dancing after hours; Ruby posted $25 bond and was released on that date. February 12, 1963, Ruby was arrested on a charge of simple assault; he was found not guilty February 27, 1963. Finally, on March 14, 1963, Ruby was arrested for allegedly ignoring traffic summonses; a $35 bond was posted. When Ruby applied for a beer license in March 1961, he reported that he had been arrested "about four or five times" between 1947 and 1953. Between 1950 and 1963, he received 20 tickets for motor vehicle violations, paying four $10 fines and three of $3. In 1956 and 1959, Ruby was placed on 6 months' probation as a traffic violator. Ruby was also frequently suspended by the Texas Liquor Control Board. In August 1949, when he was operating the Silver Spur, he was suspended for 5 days on a charge of "Agents: Moral Turpitude." In 1953 Ruby received a 5-day suspension because of an obscene show, and, in 1954, a 10-day suspension for allowing a drunkard on his premises. On February 18, 1954, he was suspended for 5 days because of an obscene striptease act at the Silver Spur and for the consumption of alcoholic beverages during prohibited hours. On March 26, 1956. Ruby was suspended by the liquor board for 3 days because several of his checks were dishonored. On October 23, 1961, he received another 3-day suspension because an agent solicited the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on licensed premises. The Warren Commission Report , p. 800 W ho was Jack Ruby? To understand him, you have to know his background. Ruby's Childhood Ruby as a young man Ruby moves to Dallas Ruby the Nightclub Owner Ruby as a person Ruby's problems with authorities Conspiracy books that portray Ruby as a mobster of some kind all have one thing in common: they ignore the testimony of people who actually knew Jack Ruby. Dave Reitzes' "In Defense of Jack Ruby" looks at the man known to his friends, employees, and acquaintances. You've heard that Ruby told the Warren Commission that he wanted to go to Washington, D.C. You've also heard that he told the Warren Commission that he would reveal a conspiracy of which he was a part in Washington. Read the relevant excerpt from Ruby's Warren Commission testimony and decide for yourself. Jack Ruby was in the Dallas Police Headquarters on the evening of November 22, 1963. In the wake of the assassination, the headquarters was a mob scene . Ruby was among the crowd of reporters present. If Ruby was "stalking" Oswald, why didn't he shoot him while he was being moved from office to office among the uncontrolled crowd? Here is the ad for Ruby's Carousel Club that appeared in the Dallas Times Herald on November 22nd, 1963. Ruby cancelled the show in the wake of the President's death. The general sleaziness of Ruby's club is conveyed by this contact sheet from the National Archives . It purports to show "women learning to strip at Jack Ruby's Carousel Club in Dallas, Texas." Ruby, however, was convinced that he had a club with real "class." Ruby and the Fair Play for Cuba Committee: Spook Assignment or Helpful Citizen? When District Attorney Henry Wade said that Lee Oswald was a member of the "Free Cuba Movement," voices in the audience corrected him. Ruby was one of those voices. Compare Oliver Stone's version of this event with the actual newsreel footage . And ask whether there really was anything sinister about this. How sinister was knowledge of Oswald and the Fair Play for Cuba Committee? In reality, news of Oswald's membership in this organization had been broadcast before 4:00 pm. Central time, and had been all over the media for almost eight hours at the time of Wade's press conference. Did Ruby Lie About His Motive? Conspiracists have always been suspicious about Ruby's claim, to the Warren Commission, that he shot Oswald so that Jackie Kennedy would not have to return to Dallas to testify at a Lee Oswald murder trial. Indeed, many have claimed that this motive was fabricated by Ruby's first attorney, Tom Howard. In fact, Ruby was sincere about Mrs. Kennedy , although that was hardly the whole story. Did Ruby Confess to Being Part of a Conspiracy? Conspiracy authors assert (or strongly imply) that Jack Ruby was part of a Kennedy assassination conspiracy, and wanted to confess to that. And indeed, a lot of his later statements show he believed there was a conspiracy -- just as millions of other Americans did. But he vehemently insisted that he was part of no conspiracy, right up through a death bed interview in the last days of his life . Letters to Ruby Courtesy of attorney Mark Zaid, a small collection of letters sent to Ruby, his attorney and Dallas officials in the wake of the Oswald shooting. These aren't necessarily representative of public sentiment, but they show that for a fair number of Americans Ruby was a hero. Letter to Ruby from a citizen in Youngstown, OH. Letter to Ruby's attorney suggesting that the Dallas cops were as much to blame as was Ruby. Card to Ruby offering "Congratulations." Letter to District Attorney Henry Wade commending Ruby's "fine deed." Letter from 14 year-old boy . Ruby's Mental State The following is from Elmer Gertz' Moment of Madness , pp. 472-474. This letter was written by Jack Ruby to his brother Earl during the time Ruby was imprisoned, and was sinking further and further into a delusional state. EARL: You must believe what I've been telling you for the past two and a half years. If you only would have believed me all along you would have found some way to check out what I said. You would have saved Israel, but now they are doomed, because they think the U.S. are for them, but they are wrong because Johnson wants to see them slaughtered and tortured. Egypt is making believe they are an ally of Russia, that is only to fool Russia and the rest of the world. The Arabs are going to over- run Israel. They are going to get help both from Russia and the U.S. It's too late now to do anything, and we are all doomed. They are torturing children here. If you only would believe what I'm telling you. Phil [Burleson] was in on the conspiracy all along, and he was very instrumental in the frameup they planned, that I was in on the assassination of the President. Don't be fooled by his working on the briefs, now that has done all the dirty work, he put himself in a position to make every effort that he is on our side. Please you must believe all I've been telling you. Earl, they are going to torture you to death, and you will witness your own family being put to death. Forgive me for all this terrible tragedy I've caused. Love I know you won't listen to me Earl, but if you go to a public phone booth, they may be watching you, pretend that you are going to a department store or a movie, and then give them the slip. Try the phone booth and call some people in N.Y. you know, and if you don't find them in, you will know something is wrong. Try your family again and if they are not at home, then try Eileen or Ann. If they don't answer then you know something is wrong. Earl I know what I am talking about, and I'm sure you think that I'm crazy. But don't forget the jury found me sane, so I'm not crazy anymore! If you know your family is gone, then you know that all is lost and you can't save anything. But you still may be able to save Israel. By getting to Miami either hitch-hike or some-way. You won't be able to fly because they will be watching for you. From Miami you must find a way to Cuba, by pretending to rent a boat to go fishing, and get to Cuba someway. From there you must find a way to Russia. Then you tell the Russians how Egypt has been using them all along, but they are much closer to Johnson, because of what is happening to the Jews in the U.S. Then they will understand what kind of person Johnson is, and then they may be able to save Israel. Russia will then be in a position to tell Johnson, that there first move if any trouble starts is not to bomb the U.S., but to wipe out Germany, that one thing Johnson don't want to happen, because he is counting on them to be the master race, also all the other former Axis partners South America, Egypt, Italy and Japan. Earl, as God is my judge, you must believe all these things I've been telling you. When you go back to your hotel, they may have a bug in your room. Don't say anything to Elmer, just take off without your clothes. Good luck and hope you believe me this time, Love always. If you should follow what I said, and you are hitch-hiking give a fictitious name, such Fleming etc. Try calling some local people, maybe they are missing already, Scheppo, Jacobson, Kaufman and others through the phone book. Please Earl, I know what I'm asking of you. you [sic] must get to either Miami or Mexico City and then to Cuba. You may have lost your family by now, but there is nothing you can do about it now and you can save millions of people who are doomed to be slaughtered. This country has been overthrown. More of Ruby's paranoid delusions are revealed in a note that Ruby wrote to Gertz. Here is the envelope in which Gertz placed the note , the first page of the note, and the second page . Ruby not only believes that a second Holocaust is underway, he believes that Jews are being tortured and killed in the very building (the County Records Building on Dealey Plaza) were he is being held. (Images are from the Library of Congress "American Memory" collection.) Ruby had this paranoid delusion even when he testified before the Warren Commission. It's not in full view in his official testimony (although there are clear hints) but it was obvious in comments he made Earl Warren (page 19): But the fellow was clearly delusional when I talked to him. He took me aside and he said, "Hear those voices, hear those voices?" He thought they were Jewish children and Jewish women who were being put to death in the building there. The Ruby Polygraph Ruby, testifying before the Warren Commission, begged to be given a polygraph ("lie detector") test, and the Commission — very much against its better judgment — gave in to his entreaties. Conspiracists have claimed that the polygraph test shows Ruby lying about knowing Oswald and being part of a conspiracy. Unfortunately, as Dave Reitzes shows in this essay from his web site , "lie detector" tests have little value, and Ruby's test provides no evidence that he was lying.

The JFK Assassination Single Bullet Theory The Single Bullet Theory I f you believe what the conspiracy books say the Warren Commission believed about the Single Bullet Theory, you would have to conclude the commissioners and staff of the commission were a bunch of fools. Conspiracy authors always show Connally seated directly in front of Kennedy, at the same height, and facing forward. You've seen Kevin Costner do this sort of thing. The graphic at right, taken from Groden and Livingstone's High Treason is an example of this. Could Commission Exhibit 399, which conspiracists have christened the "Magic Bullet," have done what the Warren Commission said it did? The Single Bullet Theory According to the Movie "JFK" Your browser does not support the video tag. But do we believe Oliver Stone? Or his this just a fantasy concocted by conspiracy theorists? The Evidence Consider, for example, James Altgen's photo of the limo rounding the corner of Main and Houston. Check out the relative heights of Kennedy and Connally. Rarely seen before, a photo of the limo made after it was returned to Washington. The right-side door is wide open, and you can plainly see the relative heights of Kennedy's seat and Connally's seat. Uploaded by Bob Artwohl to Compuserve, and uploaded here by permission. But what about the idea that Connally was sitting directly in front of Kennedy? Numerous photos of the motorcade show Connally well inboard of Kennedy in the limo. They include: The picture above left: a frame from an amateur movie shot by presidential aide Dave Powers. You can see several clips from the movie on YouTube. The Andrew Leche film likewise shows Connally well inboard and he turns around to talk to JFK. A photo shot by Dallas photographer Duane Robinson of the limo on Cedar Creek, published in Paris Match . Another photo by the same photographer a couple of seconds later. A frame from the Muchmore film , taken as the limo rounds the corner from Main to Houston Street. Courtesy of Joe Durnavich. A film put together from amateur footage by Dallas Cinema Associates (the "DCA film") has some sequences that clearly show Connally well inboard of Kennedy. Here is one sequence , and here is another . A still from the film is at right right. Thomas Canning was a NASA scientist who studied the Single Bullet trajectory for the House Select Committee on Assassinations. He used the Betzner photograph to establish a line to the right of which Connally could not have been. He also estimated the rotation of Connally's torso from the Zapruder film. The result was an alignment that showed the bullet leaving Kennedy's throat to strike Connally in the back near the shoulder — which is where Connally was actually struck. Of course, you don't really have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out. Canning used the House Select Committee scenario that had Kennedy and Connally being struck by the Single Bullet at Zapruder frame 190. More recent work has pinpointed the time of the hit to Zapruder frame 223. Various researchers have modelled the Single Bullet Theory at that frame. Failure Analysis Associates, in work done for a 1992 "mock trial" of Lee Harvey Oswald for the American Bar Association, used 3-D computer animation and modelling techniques to research the bullet trajectory, and concluded that the Single Bullet Trajectory works . Dale Myers, a specialist in computer animation, built a 3-D model of Dealey Plaza, the limo, Kennedy and Connally, and also concluded that the trajectory works.

The Back and Throat Wounds Another thing conspiracy authors will do to attack the Single Bullet Theory is to move the entrance wound in Kennedy's back down below the Warren Commission location, and move the wound in the front of Kennedy's neck up in order to require an absurd trajectory though Kennedy's body. This drawing , again taken from Groden and Livingstone's High Treason , shows this assumption. What is the evidence for the "low" back wound location? The piece of evidence that conspiracy books will most often show you is the facesheet from the autopsy. It seems to place the wound too low to be consistent with the exit wound in the front of the neck. What will the conspiracy books not tell you about this? They won't tell you that the face sheet also has a measurement placing the wound. It places the wound 14 cm. below the tip of the right mastoid process. That's not consistent with the lower dot location, but it is consistent with other statements in the autopsy. They also won't tell you what the autopsy report says about the track of the bullet through the body. The other missile entered the right superior posterior thorax above the scapula and traversed the soft tissues of the supra-scapular and the supra-clavicular portions of the base of the right side of the neck. This missile produced contusions of the right apical parietal pleura and of the apical portion of the right upper lobe of the lung. The missile contused the strap muscles of the right side of the neck, damaged the trachea and made its exit through the anterior surface of the neck. Warren Commission Report , p. 543. But how could the facesheet show that dot in a lower location, yet describe the wound in a higher location, 14 cm. below the tip of the mastoid process, above the scapula and above the clavicle? Commander J. Thornton Boswell, who drew the facesheet, was asked about this by The Baltimore Sun in 1966. He explained that he made no attempt to draw the facesheet exactly to scale, and insisted that the measurements he made were precise, and properly locate the wound. He made on "X" on a copy of the face sheet, to indicate where the wound actually was . See the November 25, 1966 issue of the Sun . Of course, photos were made at the autopsy, including photos of Kennedy's back . You can see for yourself what they show. Are Autopsy Face Sheets Supposed to be Drawn to Scale? That's the assumption of conspiracy theorists who point to Boswell's face sheet and claim that it shows the back wound "too low" to be consistent with the Single Bullet Theory. But Todd Wayne Vaughan decided to see whether this assumption is accurate . Did Gerald Ford Move the Wound in Kennedy's Back? Conspiracists have insisted that the wound in Kennedy's back was too low to be consistent with the Single Bullet Theory. Thus, the fact that Warren Commission member Gerald Ford changed the description of the wound in a draft of the Warren Commission Report from "back" to "neck" seems sinister to them. But was it really sinister, or was Ford acting in good faith ? A Pristine Bullet? To the right you will see the "magic bullet" picture shown in all the conspiracy books. CE 399 is the bullet viewed end-on. This is the picture the conspiracy books won't show you. See for yourself whether this bullet is really "pristine." The Throat Wound If moving the back wound down is a way of attacking the Single Bullet Theory, moving the throat wound up is also. If the throat wound couldn't have been the exit for a bullet that entered the back, then it was probably an entrance would from a frontal shot, which implies a shooter in front of the limo which implies conspiracy. A drawing from Groden and Livingstone's High Treason shows a typical conspiracy interpretation of the wounds. Thus conspiracy books describe the Dallas doctors as being absolutely sure that the wound in Kennedy's throat was an entrance wound. What they usually omit is the fact that the doctors who actually saw the wound speculated that it was an exit wound from a fragment from the head shot. They also imply that ER personnel can easily tell whether a wound is an entrance wound or an exit would. This essay consists of two parts. The first documents the speculations of the Dallas doctors about the wound, and the second is a passage from the JAMA describing a careful study of the ability of ER personnel to make judgments about the forensic aspects of wounds. Conspiracy authors have consistently claimed that the slits in the collar of Kennedy's shirt could not have been made by an exiting bullet. Here is a photograph of the shirt, showing the slits. Decide for yourself whether they could have been made by an exiting bullet. One piece of evidence the conspiracy authors use for a "high" location for the throat wound is the testimony of Dr. Charles Carrico. Before the Warren Commission, he supposedly said that the wound was "above the tie." In fact, his testimony isn't quite as the conspiracy authors represent it. This is his testimony , including the context. Another thing to remember here is that in his "Admission Note," written on November 22, 1963, Carrico said the wound was in the "lower 1/3" of the neck. On this matter, as on the location of the back wound, the photographic evidence is decisive. The Left Profile shows the level of the wound quite clearly. Is it really possible, as the conspiracy authors claim, for a bullet exiting at the level of the tracheostomy to have failed to penetrate Kennedy's shirt? Note that this photo has been rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise, to emphasize the location of the throat wound. A Little Logic, Please! A nybody who wants to posit that CE 399 was faked and planted by conspirators needs to supply plausible answers to all of the following questions. Why did the conspirators . . . Plant it in a location where it could easily have been lost? Plant a bullet that was only "slightly" damaged if its role was to have passed through at least the President? Why not shoot up some livestock and get a bullet a bit more mangled? Plant it before it could have been known how many other bullets would be recovered? How could they have known that CE 399 would not be the "one bullet too many" that would blow the whole plot? Plant the bullet so it was found before it was known how much lead was in JFK's neck/upper back? What if a big chunk of lead was found in JFK's neck or upper back, a chunk too big to have come from CE 399? Source: Adopted from a post by John Canal on alt.assassination.jfk Connally Holding His Hat Long after John Kennedy is seen in the Zapruder film moving his arms toward his throat in response to being hit, John Connally is seen holding his hat. Conspiracy writers insist that he could not possibly have held on to the hat after his wrist was shattered by a bullet. The implication is that yet another bullet hit Connally at some later point, contrary to the Single Bullet Theory. But Nellie Connally says that John held the hat on the way to Parkland Hospital. The late Governor Connally was a loyal son of Texas. He's probably still holding that hat. Men with more severe injuries than Connally's can hold onto things. In the following passage, Hawaii Senator Daniel K. Inouye describes how he lost his arm in combat: At last I was close enough to pull the pin on my last grenade. And as I drew my arm back, all in a flash of light and dark I saw him, that faceless German, like a strip of motion picture film running through a projector that's gone berserk. One instant he was standing waist-high in the bunker, and the next he was aiming a rifle grenade at my face from a range of ten yards. And even as I cocked my arm to throw, he fired and his rifle grenade smashed into my right elbow and exploded and all but tore my arm off. I looked at it, stunned and unbelieving. It dangled there by a few bloody shreds of tissue, my grenade still clenched in a fist that suddenly didn't belong to me anymore . . ." Daniel K. Inouye with Lawrence Elliott, Journey to Washington , Prentice-Hall 1967, pp. 151-152. Roger Byrum brought this passage to the author's attention. When Did the Single Bullet Hit Happen?" Supposedly, Connally is obviously unhurt in Zapruder frame 230, but John Kennedy is obviously reacting to being hit at this point. Thus, it is claimed, the same bullet could not have hit both men. But a careful study of the Zapruder film shows that Connally was hit at frame 223 . If the Single Bullet Theory is true, then Kennedy had to be hit at the same time, and again, detailed scrutiny of the film shows this was likely the case. But John Connally Didn't Believe the Single Bullet Theory Your browser does not support the video tag. That is correct. And why not? In a 1967 interview with Eddie Barker for CBS, he explains that he is certain that the second shot fired hit him. But he believes that the first shot hit Kennedy. He didn't see JFK hit before he was hit. But the "best witness" he knows believes JFK as hit before John. The Chain of Evidence Conspiracy books will tell you that the "chain of evidence" on Commission Exhibit 399 was broken, and that the bullet would have been inadmissible as evidence in an Oswald murder trial. They will also tell you that two hospital employees that found the bullet (Tomlinson and Wright) failed to identify the bullet as the one they found when questioned by the FBI. What are the conspiracy books not telling you? The chain of evidence for CE 399 was in fact intact, and the Warren Commission traced its possession from discovery by Tomlinson to analysis by the FBI. Bullets and other physical evidence need not be marked to be admissible in trails. This brief submitted by the prosecution in the O.J. Simpson civil trial makes this clear. Tomlinson and Wright, although failing to positively identify the bullet, said it "looks like" and "appears to be" the bullet they had recovered . Conflicting Testimony? Conspiracy-oriented author Vincent Palamara has produced a fascinating compilation of testimony that contradicts the Warren Commission's timeline on Commission Exhibit 339 — who had it, and when. Does all this show evidence being planted or tampered with, or just normal variation in witness accounts? Again, it's your call. Why not Experiment? Conspiracy books make all kinds of assertions about the inability of the Single Bullet to have done the things the Warren Commission said it did. What happens if one actually experiments, shooting mock torsos with a Mannlicher-Carcano rifle using bullets like those Oswald supposedly used? John Lattimer did that. Click here for a report of his findings . Lattimer compared an experimental bullet that did the same damage to his mock bodies that CE 399 did to Kennedy and Connally. See how similar his experimental bullet is to CE 399 . Lattimer has done a lot of work on the ballistics of the case, much of it published in peer reviewed medical journals. Here is a longish article from Wound Ballistics Review documenting much of his work. When a bullet just like Commission Exhibit 399 is fired through a human wrist bone at 2,000 feed per second, it is almost certain to be badly mangled. But when CE 399 hit Connally's wrist it had been slowed by transiting Kennedy's torso and tumbling through Connally's chest. When it finally hit the hard radius bone, it was traveling about 1,000 feet per second. Dr. Martin Fackler, President of the International Wound Ballistics Association, fired a round identical to Oswald's bullet through a human wrist at 1,100 feet per second. Here is the resulting bullet . A full account of Fackler's experiments can be found in the journal Wound Ballistics Review . Putting the Pieces Together One controversial question about the medical evidence is the angle at which the shot that hit Kennedy in the back transited his torso. The HSCA posited a nearly flat transit, that would have required Kennedy to be slumped forward. Dr. Robert Artwohl's analysis of the issue differs from that of the HSCA. Artwohl believes the bullet transited at a downward angle, as demonstrated in this analysis . Joe Durnavich has pointed out some possible sources of error in Artwohl's analysis. His computer model of the geometry of the bullet path and Kennedy's torso suggests a somewhat flatter — but still downward — angle. We have already seen the Left Profile photo, which shows the level at which the bullet exited Kennedy's neck. NECKEXIT.JPG is Artwohl's analysis, using an autopsy photograph and a photograph of Kennedy in the motorcade to show that the bullet must have passed through the collar and the tie. Uploaded by permission. Was JFK's Coat Bunched When He Was Hit in the Back? A generation of conspiracy-oriented researchers has argued that the hole in the back of Kennedy's suit coat — which is 5.3 inches below the top of the collar — is "too low" to allow the Single Bullet Theory. Supposedly, a bullet hitting "this low" could not exit the throat at the collar where the single bullet would have to. Lone gunman theorists have argued that Kennedy's coat may have been "bunched up" at the back, allowing the hole to line up with the throat exit. Two researchers here present contrary views on this. No Researcher by Nick Sylene suggests some "home tests" that he thinks prove that Kennedy's coat could not have been bunched up , and that the Single Bullet Theory can be ruled out. Yes John Hunt, Jr. has taken a different tack, and done an extensive survey of photographic evidence of JFK in the motorcade. His essay "The Case for a Bunched Jacket" shows that Kennedy's jacket was bunched in the majority of pictures of the motorcade in Dallas, and that Kennedy's posture at the time of the Single Bullet hit makes it overwhelmingly likely that the jacket was bunched at that moment. Of course, multiple photos of Kennedy show his shirt or jacket bunched.

Officer Tippit Timeline Copyright © 1997,1998 William M. Drenas. Revised 10/98 -- Added Text in Blue This discussion has no hidden agenda. It does not support anybody's pro-conspiracy or anti-conspiracy theories. I am just a regular guy who wants to find out the truth about the murders of President Kennedy and Officer J.D. Tippit. I have used the best possible research documents available to me. In most cases I have used the witness's own words, I find it very undesirable to use an author's interpretation of a witness's interview or authors who reference each other's work. Also, I have tried to use the logic and common sense that should dictate our day to day lives and have not made use of any semantics. This study may create more questions than it answers, however, this is research that I believe should have been done. Since this article was first published in July 1997, it has been my good fortune to be able to communicate with the top JFK assassination and Tippit researchers in the world. In the original article I did not acknowledge the kind people that provided me with assistance in the finished product, so now I would like to thank the following researchers for their contributions. Thank you to Ken M. Holmes Jr., Gary Mack, Darwin Payne, Dave Perry, Bill Pulte and Larry Sneed for proofreading my work and making suggestions. Thank you to Steve Hamilton at the National Archives at College Park, Maryland for all his knowledge and help. Thanks to Jim Lesar for access to the Assassination Archives and Research Center in Washington D.C. Special thanks to Greg Lowrey who shared much important information with me through Bill Pulte. This article could not have been possible if it was not for two special men that I respect not only as friends but also as top-notch researchers. A special thank you to Dave Perry for providing me with advice and many of the documents used in this article. And special thanks to Professor Bill Pulte, who has been generous enough to provide me with much new information that has never before appeared in print. In most homicide investigations it is a routine procedure to establish the activities of the victim in the last several hours of his life. Common sense tells us that this should be extremely helpful in establishing unknown information, locations of incidents, and in some cases possible motives for the murder. In the case of Officer J.D. Tippit, to my knowledge these routine procedures were never properly done. Therefore, the information presented in this article has never been assembled in one place for scholars of the Kennedy Assassination. Given the magnitude surrounding the Tippit murder, I believe that this timeline should have been done in November of 1963 while memories of events were fresh in the witnesses' minds, all the witnesses were still alive, and could have been easily located. Over the years some authors of both books and magazine articles on the Kennedy Assassination have implicated Officer Tippit as somehow being involved in the J.F.K. murder. Some have said that Tippit actually shot President Kennedy , and others insist that the very compelling image of "Badgeman" is none other than J.D. Tippit. The "Badgeman" image was discovered by researcher Gary Mack and enhanced from a black and white Polaroid picture taken by Mary Moorman. This image appears to show a man in a Dallas Police Department uniform holding a rifle and firing at the President at the time of the fatal head shot (for a visual presentation of "Badgeman" check out "The Killing of a President" by Robert Groden page 200 for a blown up, colorized version of the image.) Others still claim it was Tippit's part of the conspiracy to kill Oswald and silence him, or as in the Roscoe White affair where Roscoe allegedly asked Tippit to take Oswald to Red Bird Airport in South Oak Cliff so that he could make a getaway in a small plane. When Tippit refused, Roscoe had to shoot him. My objective is to trace Tippit's movements on the last day of his life to see if anything sinister was going on or if it was just a normal day in the life of a Dallas policeman. Tippit's shift on November 22, 1963 was 7:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M. Tippit worked out of the Dallas Police Department Southwest Substation (Batchelor Exhibit No. 5002, page 9 and Warren Commission Exhibit 2645, Volume 25, page 910.). This substation was in the 4200 block of West Illinois, Oak Cliff, Dallas. Tippit would have to drive his squad car approximately 5.7 miles to get to his patrol district #78. If Tippit had taken the most direct route and drove east on West Illinois to get to his district that means that he would pass Austin’s Barbecue on his way. Ken M. Holmes Jr. was able to locate two eyewitnesses that saw Tippit at Austin’s that morning, exact time unrecalled. Ken did much of the investigative work for the late Larry Ray Harris whom some had considered the world’s leading authority on the Tippit murder. For some reason Ken has never gotten the credit due him for all of the important work that he has done. I know that I am very thankful for all the information and time that he has shared with me. Ken is responsible for many pieces of information that we have about Tippit today. As we can see the possibility of Tippit stopping of at Austin’s certainly exists. I have not been able to locate any radio transcripts of the Dallas Police Department activities before 10:00 A.M. on this day. There are several different versions of the Channel 1 Dallas Police Department Radio Transcripts. Most transcripts have been edited to contain mostly the calls that were pertinent to the President's motorcade. There are not many calls about routine police business, such as squads going out of service for lunch, or coffee breaks. The only exception to this is in "The Kennedy Assassination Tapes" a rebuttal to the Acoustical Evidence Theory by James C. Bowles. This document is available from the National Archives and also appears in the appendix of "First Day Evidence" by Gary Savage. Dallas Police Radio Officer Bowles transcribed a very detailed and accurate log of channel 1 transmissions from 11:42A.M. to 12:37P.M. for 11/22/63. The Dallas Police Department audio tape that has been widely distributed in the Assassination Community begins at 12:15 P.M. On a recent trip to the National Archives in College Park, Maryland, I was able to locate some important documents relating to Tippit’s activities on 11/22/63. Police officers know these documents as ‘Mark Out Records’ (HSCA 180-10083-10035). In 1963 when an officer called the dispatcher to say that he would be out of the car the dispatcher would fill out one of these mark out records with pertinent information about the call, such as location, time and type of call and the initials of the dispatcher. In the original “Car 10 Where Are You” I theorized that Tippit was at the Dobbs House Restaurant that morning because of statements made by employees there. We now know by the mark out records that Tippit was not at the Dobbs House at 10:00 A.M., but was on a call in his district at 2800 East Illinois Ave . Not much is known about this call except that Tippit was ordered there at 9:56 A.M. on a signal 4 which means “out on investigation” (Warren Commission Exhibit #705 page 4) and that he cleared from that location at 10:17 A.M.. 2800 East Illinois was the location of Aluminum Screen Manufacturing Company in 1963 and that is about all that is known about this call. The first reference I could find to Tippit's activities on that day are the statements made to the FBI by Mary Ada Dowling, a waitress at the Dobbs House Restaurant, at 1221 North Beckley, (at the corner of North Beckley and Colorado) in Oak Cliff near Oswald's rooming house and Methodist Hospital. On December 6,1963, the FBI was investigating possible links between Oswald and Ruby when Mary Ada Dowling gave them the following information. She professed to recognize pictures of Oswald who had eaten breakfast at the restaurant usually between 7:00 and 7:30 A.M.. She recalled the person, now recognized as Oswald, was last seen by her in the restaurant at about 10:00 A.M. Wednesday, November 20th, at which time he was "nasty," and used curse words in connection with his order. She went on to relate that " Officer J.D. Tippit was in the restaurant, as was his habit at about that time each morning , and shot a glance at Oswald." She said there was no indication, however, that they knew each other. (1) On 12/5/63 The FBI questioned Sam Rogers, Manager of the Dobb's House. He related that since President Kennedy's assassination he recognized Oswald's picture as being that of an individual who had been a coffee customer in the Dobbs House. On that same day they also questioned Douglas Leake, another employee of the Dobbs House. Leake claimed that he had recognized pictures of Oswald as being a person who had been in Dobbs House about two times during the days preceding the assassination. Mrs. Dolores Harrison a Dobbs House employee for six years also told the FBI she recalled Oswald having been in the Dobbs House for breakfast, specific time unrecalled. She stated she recalls this particular occasion, inasmuch as Oswald had ordered "eggs over light" and, when served, made a complaint that the eggs were "cooked too hard." Mrs. Harrison advised she prepared Oswald's eggs and Mary Dowling served them to him. Mrs. Harrison went on to say that when seeing Oswald at the Dobbs House he "did not talk much and was always reading magazines or books." She related although she saw Oswald at the Dobbs House a number of times she did not know his identity until seeing his picture in the newspapers as the accused assassin of President Kennedy. Although Mary Dowling could have been mistaken about seeing Oswald at about 10:00 A.M., we do have corroborated statements that the "Oswald's eggs" story really happened, and statements that Oswald had eaten in the Dobbs House at different times. The Dobbs House was only two blocks away from his rooming house it is logical that he did indeed eat there on occasion. The statement that Tippit was in the restaurant , as was his habit about the same time each morning, is very curious. There is a big difference in mistaking someone that you have seen a few times (in this case Oswald) as opposed to a person you would see at the same time at the same location everyday, and perhaps know personally or at least by name. The Dobbs House was a little over six miles Northwest from the closest point of Tippit's assigned patrol district, #78 and under normal driving conditions would take 17 minutes to make this trip. Given the fact that Tippit had worked the Oak Cliff Area for many years and he probably knew many short cuts for his travels around Oak Cliff. Also the fact that he was driving a police car and was not really subject to traffic laws, the travel times that are stated for normal conditions could have been reduced by a few minutes, although he still would have to deal with vehicle and pedestrian traffic to some degree. From this point on this reduced time will be referred to as Tippit Travel Time. As we shall see, there are other reports of him being far from his patrol district on a regular basis. For Tippit to have a coffee break at Dobb's House at 1221 N. Beckley, It would take a minimum of 15 minutes to get there from his patrol district, about 10-15 minutes for coffee and at least 15 minutes to get back to Tippit's assigned patrol district. A grand total of about 45 minutes. It defies logic that the Dallas Police Department would authorize a coffee break location that was that far from Tippit's Patrol District. Unfortunately, neither Mary Dowling nor Dolores Harrison (also a waitress at the Dobbs House) ever testified for the Warren Commission or the House Select Committee on Assassinations. A search of the National Archives On-line Data Base, failed to find any documents containing these names. To the best of my knowledge no independent researchers have ever interviewed them. The questioning that was done by the FBI was to investigate the Oswald-Ruby connection, not to retrace Tippit's movements. From the eyewitness accounts that are available, we can only guess if Tippit stopped at the Dobbs House restaurant on the morning of November 22, 1963, at his usual time for coffee, since this day probably started off like any other day. The next traceable Tippit sighting is by his best friend and fellow Police Officer, Bill Anglin, from HSCA document # 180-10108-10451 which is a summary of an interview with Anglin on November 11, 1977, where he states "he and J.D. had coffee or tea at "The Old Drive-In" (one source of part-time employment) about 11:30 to 11:45 A.M. on the Morning of November 22, 1963, J.D. usually went home for lunch working day tour." If this was the case, logic would dictate that they met at Austin's Barbecue, located at 2321 West Illinois Avenue. Tippit worked there as a security guard from 10:00 P.M. to 2:00 A.M. on Friday and Saturday nights, from about late 1960 up until the time of the assassination. (2) In a 1982 interview Sgt. Anglin was asked where exactly they had coffee that morning, he replied "it was in Deep South Oak Cliff out on our beat." Although there could have been several Drive-In style Restaurants in that area in 1963 the only Restaurant that Tippit was known to work at was Austin's. Austin's Barbecue was not in Tippit's regular patrol district, #78 nor Anglin's district #79. (3) I have personally searched microfilms of Dallas City Directories for 1963 and several years before and after 1963 and could not find any listing for the "Old Drive-In." At this point I contacted some well informed Dallas area researchers and they had never heard of the "Old Drive In." Given this information it is possible that they met at Austin's Barbecue. Whether or not it happened between 11:30 and 11:45 A.M. will be further discussed. If it turns out that they had coffee in some location on their beats, the timeline remains basically the same, because the distance from the point where Tippit's and Anglin's district meets to Tippit's house is about the same. In the original “Car 10 Where Are You” article I went through a long explanation of how Bill Anglin could have been mistaken about the exact time that he had “coffee or tea at “The Old Drive-In” with J.D. Tippit on the morning of the assassination. At this point I would like to thank Dale Myers for his excellent book With Malice . This book is a moment to moment account of the Tippit Murder and is a must for anybody that is interested in this crime. In With Malice Dale relates information that he received in his interview with Bill Anglin on March 29, 1983. Thank you Bill Anglin and Dale Myers for clarifying this information for all researchers. Bill Anglin told Dale “We had a cup of tea together at about ten thirty. My beat joined his and we met at a little drive-in – the Rebel Drive-In”( With Malice by Dale Myers page 39). Bill Anglin said they met “out on our beat” in his HSCA interview. Tippit’s and Anglin’s districts split at Leadbetter Drive and that is exactly where The Rebel Drive-In was located between Leadbetter Drive and South Loop 12 at 3172 South Loop 12. (1963 Dallas City Directory). Bill Anglin also told Dale that “As I recall we both got busy right after the break for tea and went our separate ways.” This is true. Another mark out record shows that Tippit was called away to the intersection of Annarbor and Corrigan Avenue about 1.5 miles from the Rebel Drive-In just outside of Tippit’s district. Not much is known about this call except that Tippit was ordered there at 10:40 A.M., about 10 minutes after he met Bill Anglin and Tippit was cleared from the location at 10:45 A.M. In 1963 this intersection contained residential as well as business locations. Some of the businesses there in 1963 were Hardin’s Service Station, Alma’s Beauty Shop, Capps Washateria, Molina Associates Plumbing Co. and Pete’s Diner. Today it is still unknown to the best of my knowledge what the nature or purpose of this call was. Clearing from this location at 10:45 A.M. Tippit would have had plenty of time to drive the 5.2 miles from the intersection of Annarbor and Corrigan to his home at 238 Glencairn . Under normal driving circumstances this ride would have taken about 15 minutes, and arriving at his home for lunch at the estimated time of 11:15 A.M. is definitely possible. Tippit's immediate supervisor for about ten years, Sgt. Calvin Bud Owens, gives us some interesting information in Warren Commission exhibit No. 2985 page 8. He states that " Officer Tippit had gone home to eat lunch, which was a normal and approved procedure, at about noon time ." However, he does not mention how long Tippit's authorized lunch break was. A review of the Bowles transcript reveals that most squads that were authorized for a "Signal 5"(absence of duty for the purpose of eating or for coffee) stayed out of service anywhere from 26 minutes to 36 minutes. It would be safe to say that the standard time allowed for police officers to have lunch would be approximately 30 minutes. Officer Tippit's widow, Mrs. Marie Tippit, told HSCA interviewer John Moriarty, that "J.D. had come home for lunch that day and nothing remarkable happened." But no exact time is mentioned. (4) So we can only make an educated guess about the actual time. If the time of 11:30 A.M. to 11:45 A.M. for a coffee break is correct we have a timing problem for Tippit. If he left Austin's Barbecue at 11:45 and went straight home to 238 Glencairn in South Oak Cliff this is a distance of approximately 6 miles, and under normal driving conditions would take approximately 18 minutes. Using Tippit Travel Time it could have taken him approximately 14 to 15 minutes to get home for lunch at about 12 noon. Seems logical, most people have lunch at that time, right? but in this case it is wrong because Tippit radios the Police Dispatcher twice at 11:50 A.M. reporting that he was "clear" and the dispatcher responds "78 clear 11:51"(Bowles Transcript). Given the time of day the probability is high that these calls were Tippit returning back to service from lunch. We have the following timetable: 11:30-11:45 A.M. coffee at Austin's Barbecue 11:45-12:00 Noon travel time from Austin's to Tippit's home, 238 Glencairn ?????? Lunch 11:50 A.M. Tippit reports he is "clear" (most likely after lunch) The problem with this timetable is that he didn't have time for lunch, and we know by the interview of his widow that he definitely ate lunch at home on November 22, 1963. Using this information it doesn't make sense that he drove 6 miles out of his way to go home only to immediately turn around and make a seven-mile trip back to the location where he calls the dispatcher from in his patrol district without eating lunch. Also he was "clear" to go back into service before he got home for lunch? This just does not make sense. After much thought about this the only feasible conclusion that can be drawn is that Bill Anglin was mistaken about what time they had coffee. The event happened in 1963 and Sgt. Anglin was interviewed about this in 1977. After 14 years the events of that day could be confused, so, with all do respect and without questioning Sgt. Anglin's truthfulness or veracity it most likely could have been an honest mistake. If they had coffee between 10:45 and 11:00 A.M. at Austin's then the timetable works out much better. 10:45 -11:00 A.M. Coffee at Austin's Barbecue 11:00 -11:15 A.M. travel time from Austin's to Tippit's home, 238 Glencairn 11:15 - approx. 11:50 A.M. lunch at Tippit's home 11:50 A.M. Tippit radios he is back in service from lunch, and starts driving back toward his Patrol District. 11:50A.M.-12:17 P.M. travel time from 238 Glencairn back to Tippit's patrol district. It is important to give the reader some background information about Dallas Police Department procedures concerning radio calls from squad cars. In 1963 Officers were not equipped with walkie-talkies, so every time an Officer would get out of his vehicle he would have to radio or telephone the dispatcher telling them that he would be out of the car and at what location. In reviewing Tippit's background I have found that he had missed radio calls on the following dates: 1/22/58, 3/18/59, 8/1/61, 5/15/63 This means that the dispatcher called him on the radio and he did not answer. (5) These actions were documented in subsequent reports by his superiors. We can be sure that Tippit was not the only Dallas Police officer to ever miss a radio call. I do not know if this is within the guidelines of acceptable conduct of a police officer, given the fact that Tippit missed four radio calls in the space of about five years and five months, or if this performance record was any better or any worse than other Dallas Police Officers. At 12:17P.M. Tippit radios the dispatcher and says "be out of the car for a minute, 4100 block of Bonnie View." This information comes from the Bowles Channel 1 transcript. Close examination of this document shows that the Police Dispatcher did not transmit an order for Tippit to go to this location on Bonnie View. Perhaps as Tippit was patrolling his district after lunch, he noticed something suspicious or was stopped by a citizen and asked to investigate whatever was going on at the 4100 block of Bonnie View Rd. 4100 Bonnie View is 7.5 miles from Tippit's home with a normal travel time of 24 minutes, Tippit Travel Time could have been 18-20 minutes this would have given Tippit plenty of time from 11:50A.M. when he cleared from lunch to travel to the location in his patrol district where he got out of the car at 12:17P.M. In Judy Bonner's book "Investigation of a Homicide"on page 71 she states "The Bonnie View call turned out to be a dry run, an elderly woman who had thought she had seen a man trying to burglarize a house next door. Tippit politely took down her story, made a fruitless search of the neighborhood, returned to his car to write out a report, then radioed in for another assignment." I do not know how Judy Bonner obtained this information? Tippit was killed one hour later and a search for the report mentioned has proved unsuccessful. Whatever happened at 4100 Bonnie View did not last long since Tippit called back the Dispatcher 3 minutes later at 12:20P.M. and reported "78 clear." Even though Tippit was not ordered to the 4100 block of Bonnie View RD. by the Police Dispatcher, there is no hard evidence to disprove that this event was genuine. There is also no hard evidence to prove this event was staged in any way, since the location he stopped at was known to the dispatcher and potential witnesses could have been located if the situation called for it. The best information available places Tippit at the 4100 block of Bonnie View Rd. between 12:17 and 12:20P.M. on 11/22/63. Shortly after publishing this article Irish researcher Chris Scally sent me a letter he received from the late Larry Harris in 1984 that contained information about the 4100 Bonnie View call . Larry wrote “In 1978 I interviewed the manager of a grocery market at 4121 Bonnie View; He told me that during the noon hour on 11/22/63, he caught a woman shoplifter and phoned the police; it was Tippit who responded. The store manager knew Tippit because it was almost invariably Tippit who responded to calls for shoplifters. The manager told me that Tippit placed the woman in the squad car and left. So indeed Tippit was on an investigation at 12:17 P.M. nevertheless, it is disturbing and perhaps significant that this incident is not reflected more substantially in the tapes or transcripts.” Larry Harris’s investigator Ken M. Holmes Jr confirms this story. In 1963 Hodges Super Market occupied 4121 Bonnie View Road (1963 Dallas City Directory). On my last trip to Dallas in November of 1997 the small shopping plaza that contained this store was vacant with for sale signs on it. Who this shoplifter was, what happened to her, how Tippit was really alerted to this location and what impact this could have had on the events that follow are still not known. This story has confirmation from the grocer who was a known and interviewed eyewitness, where as the story from ‘Investigation of a Homicide’ that was previously reported in the original article has never been confirmed. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ABOUT THE LUNCH TIME OR THE CALL AT 4100 BONNIE VIEW? Just this, if Tippit, as some have speculated was involved in the assassination as either a shooter or a conspirator it is now 12:20 P.M. and he is approximately 7.5 miles from Dealey Plaza, the site of the Kennedy Assassination. The original time for President Kennedy's arrival at the Dallas Trade Mart was 12:30 P.M. (6) which means the President would be in Dealey Plaza at approximately 12:15-12:20 P.M. if the motorcade was running on schedule. I understand that if Tippit was involved in the assassination he could have monitored the motorcade's progress on Channel 2 of the Police radio to find out it's exact location. By going for coffee with his best friend and then home for lunch and then stop to investigate at 4100 Bonnie View he would be cutting it too close if he needed to get to downtown Dallas to take part in the shooting or to aid the assassins in anyway. The next time we are able to locate Tippit is from information on the radio logs. At 12:45 P.M., 15 minutes after the assassination, he is asked his location and he responds "I'm about Keist and Bonnie View ," which is in his patrol district. Then, comes the message that has been debated since the day that it happened. Dispatcher Murray Jackson, (a close personal friend of Tippit's) orders squad "#87 and #78 move into Central Oak Cliff area." Jackson's reasoning for this is "there was the shooting involving the President and we immediately dispatched every available unit to the Triple Underpass, where the shot was reported to have come from. I realized that we were draining the Oak Cliff area of available Police Officers so if there was an emergency such as a robbery or a major accident to come up I wouldn't have anybody there that would be in close proximity to answer the call. And since J.D. was the outermost Unit, actually I had two Units, #87 which was Officer Nelson and #78 which was Officer Tippit" (in actuality Bill Anglin's District #79 was farther south and further away from the Texas School Book Depository than Tippit's District #78). (7) It is also interesting to note that Bill Anglin responded to the 12:42P.M. radio call from the police dispatcher that said. "Attention all squads in the downtown area code 3 (red lights and siren) to Elm and Houston (Dealey Plaza) with caution. At 12:52P.M. Anglin radios the dispatcher that he will "be out at the triple underpass"(Dealey Plaza). Here is where it gets very interesting, at approximately 12:45 to 1:00 P.M. there are 5 witnesses that placed Tippit not in Central Oak Cliff but at the Gloco (Good Luck Oil Company) gas station which was located at 1502 North Zangs Boulevard. This is the absolute northernmost part of Oak Cliff. A 1966 article in "Ramparts" magazine by researcher, William Turner, states that on a recent trip to Dallas he "uncovered five witnesses to Tippit's whereabouts in the last minutes of his life. There is no indication that the Commission or any police agency was even aware of them. Photographer, Al Volkland, and his wife, Lou, both of whom knew Tippit, said that 15 or 20 minutes after the assassination they saw him at a gas station and waved to him. They observed Tippit sitting in his police car at a Gloco gas station in Oak Cliff, watching the cars coming over the Houston Street Viaduct from downtown Dallas. Three employees of the Gloco station, Tom Mullins, Emmett Hollingshead, and J.B. "Shorty" Lewis, all of whom knew Tippit confirmed the Volklands' story. (In 1987 Dallas area researcher Greg Lowery located two of the five witnesses just mentioned and they verified the account they had witnessed 24 years earlier, and there was no indication that any law enforcement agency had ever interviewed these five witnesses. This story was published in the Oak Cliff Tribune June 30, 1988). They said Tippit stayed at the station for about 10 minutes, somewhere between 12:45 and 1:00 P.M., then he went tearing off down Lancaster at high speed -on a bee-line toward Jack Ruby's apartment and in the direction of where he was killed a few minutes later." I hope this last statement about Ruby's apartment does not lead the reader to a sinister conclusion. In all fairness to the witnesses at the Gloco station that made the statement I would like to mention again that Tippit was at the northernmost part of Oak Cliff. Tippit could only go south if he was to stay in Oak Cliff. It is true that traveling south on Lancaster is the general direction of Jack Ruby's apartment but it is also the general direction of Tippit's patrol district, the Top 10 Record Shop, Tippit's home and other Oak Cliff landmarks (see map of Tippit locations). This information has been provided by Tippit expert Greg Lowrey by way of Bill Pulte. Greg recalled his interviews with Gloco Station employees Emmett Hollingshead and J.B. “Shorty” Lewis. They were both certain that Tippit arrived at the Gloco Station “a few minutes” after the shots were fired in Dealey Plaza. Greg said “There was simply no doubt whatever about this in their minds they were absolutely certain”. Bill Pulte informs me that these witnesses could have heard on the radio that shots were fired at the motorcade within minutes of the assassination. Or motorists coming off the Houston Street Viaduct stopping for gas could have informed the Gloco employees about the shooting. The location of the former Gloco Station is about 1.5 miles from the Texas School Book Depository. Some have speculated that Tippit was at the Gloco Station at 1:03 P.M., was away from his radio and somehow missed the call from the police dispatcher. There are no documented witness statements to support the fact that he left the car. Bill Pulte informs me that during this era some policeman would turn their police radios up all the way and leave the door to the squad car open if they left the vehicle and were going to remain close by the car. This would give the officer a better chance of hearing the police radio and decreasing the probability of missing a call. If in fact Tippit needed to go inside the Gloco station for some reason he could have possibly moved the squad car from the spot where he was watching the traffic come over the Houston Street Viaduct to another location closer to the actual building then exited the squad car. This combined with the ‘open door technique’ could minimize the chance of Tippit missing a call. The article continues on to ask the following legitimate questions "What could Tippit have heard or seen to cause him to leave his observation post at the Gloco station and roar up the street? Police radio logs show no instructions to move. We know that cab driver William Whaley said he drove Oswald across the Houston Street Viaduct (past the Gloco station at the same time Tippit was reported there) to a spot near the rooming house (1026 North Beckley). Is it possible that Tippit spotted Oswald in the cab, recognized him, and for some reason took off to intercept him?" Let us look at these statements analytically. At 12:45 P.M. the Police Dispatcher asks Tippit his location, Tippit replies "I'm about Keist and Bonnie View" (8) , we have to question the truthfulness of this statement. Police dispatcher, Murray Jackson, has stated in an interview that "If somebody is out of pocket off their district and you ask them their location, they are either not going to answer or they are going to give you somewhere else anyway." It is much easier to believe that Tippit was not being truthful about his location than to discount the statements of five witnesses that knew him personally and place him at a location approximately 5 miles away from the location he reported, at approximately the same time. The estimated travel time from Keist and Bonnie View to the Gloco station under normal driving conditions, is 18 minutes and 13-14 minutes for Tippit Travel Time. Given his witnessed location at 12:45 to 1:00 P.M. and the travel time involved it would seem more logical that Tippit had ventured out of his patrol district at approximately the time of the assassination for some unknown reason. Regardless of how good an officer J.D. Tippit was he could not have been in two places at the same time. At 12:54 P.M. dispatcher Murray Jackson, calls Tippit for his location and Tippit responds by saying that he is at " Lancaster and Eighth ." It is about 8/10's of a mile from the Gloco station to Lancaster and Eighth. Normal travel time is about 4 minutes but since he was "tearing" when he left the gas station he could have made it in as little as 1-2 minutes. This definitely fits into the time frame and the direction he was headed as described by the five witnesses. Some researchers have speculated that Tippit might have stopped off to see Harry Olsen, a Dallas Police Officer, who had broken his knee cap and by his own admission had taken a side job guarding an "Estate" in Oak Cliff from 7:00A.M. until 8:00P.M. on the day of the Assassination. (9) This is in the general area of the Tippit shooting. He could not remember many details about it, but he said the "estate" was on Eighth Street but he could not remember the exact location or address. Neither the Warren Commission, nor the House Select Committee asked him specifically if Tippit stopped off to see him. The following is a portion of the questioning of Harry Olsen by Warren Commission Lawyer Arlen Specter. Mr. Specter. Did you have any visitors while you were guarding the estate on that day? Mr. Olsen. Yes, sir. Mr. Specter. And who was the visitor or visitors? Mr. Olsen. Kay (10) Mr. Specter. What time did she visit you? Mr. Olsen. Right after the President was shot. Mr. Specter. How did you learn of the assassination of the President? Mr. Olsen. A woman called me on the phone who was a friend of the person who had lived there. Mr. Specter. Do you know who that woman was? Mr. Olsen. No, sir. And she wanted to know if I had heard the news, and I said no, and she said, "The President has been shot." Mr. Specter. What time did that telephone call occur? Mr. Olsen. Right after he was shot. I don't know exactly what time it was. Mr. Specter. Did you talk to anybody else on the telephone or in person between the telephone call and the time that Kay visited you? Mr. Olsen. Passers-by. I went outside. Mr. Specter. Whom did you see outside? Mr. Olsen. No one who I knew by name. They just said, "have you heard the news?" And I said, "yes, I had." WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN? The Olsen "estate" story has been looked at in many different ways by the research community. It is amazing to me that although the House Select Committee knew about the lingering questions concerning Olsen's activities on the afternoon of the assassination they did not ask any specific questions to try and clarify the situation, when Olsen gave a sworn deposition to House Select Committee Counsel, Robert Genzman, on August 21, 1978. Olsen testified to the Warren Commission that the "estate" was about four blocks from Kay Coleman's apartment , which we know was at 325 North Ewing. (11) Using this information the "estate's" approximate location on Eighth Street can be found. On a recent trip to Dallas I was taken to this area by a Texas researcher that has thoroughly studied these circumstances. The two very strong possible locations for the "estate" are 423 Eighth Street or 431 Eighth Street. (12) On a recent visit to The Assassination Archives and Research Center in Washington D.C. I was able to locate a 1967 interview of Harry Olsen by researcher William Turner. Several things are talked about in the interview, but Olsen’s remarks of special interest to us concerning this article are “Olsen said that on the day of the assassination he was guarding a ramshackle house in Oak Cliff, sitting inside. He said an attorney had hired him to guard the property of a recently deceased person. He heard the sirens but did not see anything himself. If this information is true about a ‘ramshackle house’ then it is possible that researchers should have been looking for a structure that would appear much different from the ‘estate’ mentioned in Olsen’s Warren Commission testimony. Lawyer friends of mine point out that an estate can be a large piece of property and can also mean all the property and debts left by someone at death, both definitions are commonly used. Still to this date it is unclear of the exact location of this ‘estate.’ Since there is no solid evidence to prove that Olsen did see Tippit or that Tippit drove past Olsen's location, and given Olsen's testimony the most intelligent conclusion at this time is that Tippit did not stop off to see Harry Olsen. Even though Olsen admitted that he knew Tippit, (13) the timeline illustrated here does not give Tippit much time to visit Olsen. I believe Tippit had other pressing matters to attend to. We now have Tippit "tearing" south on Lancaster from the Gloco gas station at the corner of North Zangs and North Marsalis Ave.. The exact route Tippit took to the next sighting has many different possibilities. Because of the lack of witnesses at this point in the timeline we will probably never know Tippit's exact movements. Professor Bill Pulte related to me the following story. Bill was interviewing an individual who had lived in the neighborhood Tippit was killed since the early 1960s. The interviewee spoke on the condition that his identity would remain confidential; Bill Pulte informs me that his information on other points was very accurate. They talked about many things concerning the Tippit shooting and the individual told Bill “If you are planning to do more research on Tippit, you should find out about a fight that took place at 12th and Marsalis a few minutes before Tippit was killed.” To this day any additional details about this fight are not known. Could Tippit have observed a fight and watched one or more of the participants take off in an automobile or by foot? Could someone have stopped Tippit’s squad car and told them about a fight? Could Tippit himself have been involved in a fight? These are questions that we may never find the answers to. We do know these facts. There is no transmission on the police radio alerting Tippit to respond to 12th and Marsalis. Tippit was tearing down Lancaster Road from the Gloco station heading in the direction towards 12th and Marsalis (see updated map). If Tippit was involved in something at 12th and Marsalis, that could account for an unspecified amount of additional time between the Tippit sighting at the Gloco station and the sighting at the Top 10 Record Shop. The next Tippit encounter is one that has been reported in several different books and magazine articles but this incident remained unclear to me until I obtained transcripts of the interviews with the two men who were involved. This sighting took place at The Top Ten Record Shop which is near the corner of West Jefferson Boulevard and Bishop Ave. about one block West of the Texas Theater. Louis Cortinas, was an eighteen year-old clerk, in the record shop in 1963. The shop's owner and his boss was Dub Stark. In a 1981 interview with Dallas Morning News reporter Earl Golz, Cortinas stated the following: " He was behind the counter at The Top Ten Record Shop, 338 West Jefferson Boulevard, on November 22, 1963. Police Officer, J.D. Tippit, parked his car on Bishop Street, apparently heading North, and came into the shop in a hurry and asked Cortinas if he could use the phone at the counter. He recalls Tippit being in such a hurry that he had to ask people in the narrow aisle to step aside." "Tippit said nothing over the phone, apparently not getting an answer. He stood there long enough for it to ring seven or eight times. Tippit hung up the phone and walked off fast, he was upset or worried about something." "Tippit sped away in his squad car across Jefferson, down Bishop, to Sunset where he ran a stop sign and turned right down Sunset." "Maybe 10, no more than 10 minutes Tippit had left when I heard he had been shot on the radio." Cortinas said, "Tippit would come into the record shop occasionally to use the phone while on duty. He knew Tippit to talk to from other experience, having been ticketed many times for drag racing near Austin's Barbecue. He also knew Tippit from seeing him at Austin's Barbecue." Dub Stark also stated that "Tippit parked his patrol car outside, his partner was not with him on this occasion, he asked permission to use the phone, made a phone call, and left in a hurry and didn't say anything." Stark went on to say, "he had just enough time to get to the place where he was shot." Stark knew Tippit because "Tippit often came in the store to buy records for his children, he also stopped by while on duty to use the phone several times." Again, we find Tippit far off his patrol district on a regular basis. The call must have been of an urgent nature because Tippit's behavior and the statements of the witnesses. In an interview with Detective Gus Rose (one of the first police officials to interrogate Oswald), he gives us insight about the circumstances that existed for the Dallas Police Department on 11/22/63. "On a day with that much going on Tippit would have been under tremendous pressure to stay on the radio, if he had a little something personal that he wanted to take care of he would have probably run in the record shop in a hurry and tried to do it and get back out on that radio. And he wouldn't check out on the air. I mean he wouldn't try to get the dispatcher and say I am gonna be out of the car for something special that is personal. He wouldn't want to have to answer for it." Was the phone call official police business? The witnesses said there was no conversation, so logic would tell us there was no answer on the other end. If it had been a busy signal he would have hung up the phone immediately but Cortinas estimated it rang about seven or eight times. This would be highly unlikely if he was calling Dallas Police Headquarters. He might have called in if he had important information that he didn't want broadcast over the radio. It doesn't make sense for him to call on the telephone to find out what all the commotion was in Downtown Dallas because from 1:00 P.M. until 1:15 P.M. the radio traffic was very slow. (14) I have just finished part two of a three part article on the Top Ten Record Shop for ‘The Dealey Plaza Echo’ in England. The events and the people involved at the Top 10 Record Shop are talked about in greater detail than in this article. You may contact Ian Griggs by e-mail igriggs@hotmail.com for information about obtaining these magazines. Police dispatcher Murray Jackson called #78 (Tippit) at 1:03 P.M. (15) and got no answer. One can guess, using logic, that if Tippit was at Lancaster and Eighth at 12:54 P.M. he could have easily arrived at the Top Ten Record Shop a distance of 2 miles before 1:00 P.M. and could have been inside the record shop when the unanswered call was made. The distance from the Top Ten Record Shop to 404 E. 10th St.(the Tippit Murder sight) is 6/10's of a mile with a travel time of about two minutes. This information is provided by Greg Lowrey by way of Bill Pulte. James A. Andrews worked for American National Life Insurance whose offices were located across the street from Austin’s Barbecue. Greg Lowrey was interviewing Andrews to get recollections of Roscoe White who worked out of the same office as Andrews. During the interview Andrews told Greg “Since you are interested in the assassination, let me tell you something that happened” and told the following story. James A. Andrew’s was returning to work at his office in Oak Cliff a little after 1:00 P.M. on 11/22/63. He was driving west on West 10th Street (about eight or nine blocks from where Tippit was shot minutes later, see map). Suddenly a police car also traveling west on West 10th Street came up from behind Andrews’ car, passed him and cut in front of Andrews’s car forcing him to stop. The police car pulled in front of Andrews’ car at an angle heading into the curb in order to stop him. The officer then jumped out of the patrol car motioned to Andrews to remain stopped, ran back to Andrews’ car, and looked in the space between the front seat and the back seat. Without saying a word the policeman went back to the patrol car and then drove off quickly. Andrews was perplexed by this strange behavior and looked at the officer’s nameplate, which read “Tippit” (Tippit was wearing his nameplate on 11/22/63. This is documented in a list of personal effects removed from his body at the time of death. Source: Dallas Municipal Archives) Andrews remarked that Tippit seemed to be very upset and agitated and was acting wild. We know by the statements Louis Cortinas at the Top Ten Record Shop that Tippit was last seen running a stop sign and traveling east on Sunset Ave. The location of Andrews’ encounter with Tippit is approximately 2 blocks northwest of the record shop. Did this event happen before or after Tippit was seen at the record shop? Given Andrews’ statement that this happened a little after 1:00 P.M. let us use the 1:03 P.M. missed call as a benchmark. Since the only documented time that Tippit was away from his car radio was when he went into the record shop, the probability is high that James A. Andrews’ encounter with J.D. Tippit happened just moments after Tippit was seen at the record shop. Tippit could have gone east on Sunset then gone north on Madison or Zangs then taken a left onto West 10th Street and this would have put Tippit traveling in the proper direction to have ‘cut off’ Andrews’ car that was also traveling west on West 10th Street. Why did Tippit choose Andrews’ car to stop? Why didn’t he pull over Andrews’ car using conventional police procedure by using red lights and siren and stopping to the rear of Andrews’ car? Why did Tippit ‘cut off’ Andrews car the way he did? Why didn’t Tippit speak to Andrews or give him any explanation for what was going on? Why was Tippit so upset and acting the way he did? If these questions could be answered it would be very helpful in determining what was going on in the last minutes of Tippit’s life. Exactly where Tippit went and for how long after his sighting at the record shop and after his encounter with James A. Andrews are still unknown. I would like to take a moment to talk about an event that has perplexed many researchers over the years. Just after Lee Harvey Oswald returned to his rooming house at 1026 North Beckley at about 1:00P.M. on 11/22/63 Earlene Roberts who was the housekeeper at the rooming house noticed that a Dallas Police car pulled up in front of the rooming house and honked the horn twice and then drove away. This happened while Oswald was in his room. There has been so much written about this event that a full length article could be written about it but, I would like to give the reader a few facts. In Earlene Roberts Warren Commission testimony she states that the Police car had 2 uniformed officers in it, Tippit was alone in Car 10 on 11/22/63. At approximately the time Earlene Roberts states this event happened we have at least 2 witnesses at the Top 10 Record Shop that state Tippit was in the shop at that time. Many of the researchers that theorized that Tippit drove by the rooming house and honked the horn were unfamiliar with the Top 10 Record Shop witnesses, or wrote their theories before these interviews were conducted and made available. Using the best information we have at this time it is highly improbable that Tippit performed the horn honking event since he was at a different location 1.2 miles away with a travel time of 6 minutes and a Tippit travel time of three to four minutes. There have been many references in print to 2 calls that were made at 1:08 on the Dallas Police Radio. The original source of this information is the March 23,1964 transcript of the channel 1 radio log, Commission Exhibit 705 page 17 in Vol. 17 page 406 of the Warren Commission Hearings. The transcript states that #78 (Tippit) called the dispatcher once just before 1:08 and then seconds later at exactly 1:08, but the dispatcher did not answer. Most researchers that have studied the many versions of the radio logs agree that Arch Kimbrough's Critics Copy is an excellent reference tool. Assassination researcher Russ Shearer has published a user-friendly copy of Arch’s original work. I highly recommend this transcript to everybody who is interested not only in the Tippit murder but also the Kennedy assassination; it is a vital piece of evidence in studying these events. It is available from Russ at 258 Coolidge Ave., Absecon, N.J. 08201 or russ63@ix.netcom.com. The two radio calls in question at 1:08 do not appear in Arch's transcript. Upon discovering this discrepancy I started doing a great deal of work with my audio copy of the Dallas Police Tapes. I used noise filters to "clean up" the overall sound quality and used a 31 band graphic equalizer to make the voices on the tape clearer and more pronounced. After much study I concluded that the transmission was not made by Tippit but instead was made by "388" a unit from the Criminal Investigation Division. "388" was having a conversation with the dispatcher at about this time. Transmission #390A On page 31 of the Arch Kimbrough's Channel 1 transcript is what I believe was mistaken as "78" since it is slightly garbled. By comparing the voice characteristics of the calls Tippit made earlier in the tape to the 1:08 call in question I concluded that the voices did not match. At this point I contacted a very well respected Dallas researcher who has a great deal of experience listening to these tapes and he is in agreement with me that the 1:08 transmission is "388" and not Tippit. Give the tape a listen , what do you think? Cortinas said he sped away from the record shop but by the time Tippit gets near the corner of East 10th and Patton Ave. Tippit Murder witness Helen Markham testifies Tippit's police car was "driving real slow now, real slow." (16) William Scoggins a cab driver that also witnessed the Tippit murder while he was parked in his cab eating lunch near the murder scene describes Tippit's Patrol car as cruising "Not more than 10 or 12 miles a hour." Why would Tippit drive in such an erratic way? First very fast, then very slow in the last few minutes of his life may never be explained. Professor Bill Pulte has a possible explanation for Tippit’s erratic movements in the final minutes of his life. Bill explained to me that Tippit’s movements are consistent with the actions of a man frantically looking for someone. Let us look at Tippit’s movements: Sitting at the Gloco station watching the cars come over the Houston Street Viaduct. Leaves the Gloco station and “tears” down Lancaster Road at a fast rate of speed. Could have possibly been involved in a “fight” at 12th and Marsalis. Makes a hurried phone call at the Top Ten Record Shop, and does not get an answer. Stops James A. Andrews car by cutting in front of him, does not say a word but looks between the front and back seats, and then leaves the scene without saying a word. Moments later Tippit is seen at the corner of 10th and Patton by William Scoggins and Helen Markham and they both remark in their testimonies that Tippit’s car is traveling very slowly. The 12:45 P.M. Dallas Police Radio broadcast alerted all police units to the description of the suspect in the assassination and the ‘manhunt’ began. It is not known if Tippit was performing police business or personal business during this time frame in question, but it seems that Tippit was searching for a certain individual at certain locations for reasons that are still unknown. The best current information is that in the moments before his death, Tippit knew nothing more about the assassin than his description, which could have fit the description of hundreds of men on the streets of Oak Cliff that day. Dallas radio personality Kevin McCarthy had a number of talk shows dealing with the assassination in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Bill Pulte heard this broadcast and repeated the following to me from memory. A man called into the radio program and told this story. “My girlfriend told me something that might be important about the Tippit murder. She was driving east on 10th Street behind a police car; she was some distance behind it. The officer in the police car hit his brakes quickly and backed the car up very fast. The woman hit her brakes but could not stop completely and bumped the rear of the police car. She said “Oh no” to herself because she hit the police car and thought that the officer was going to be upset and give her a ticket, but the officer did not pay any attention to her. She backed up went around the police car and drove on her way. Later she recalled that the location where this happened was exactly where Tippit’s car was when he was killed, and she realized that she had bumped Tippit’s car.” Bill Pulte said that “the caller sounded excited and completely unrehearsed, and the call seemed spontaneous” The caller said that his girlfriend refused to come forward with her story because she did not want to get involved. In reviewing Barnes Exhibit C we notice that Tippit’s squad car is not parked parallel with the curb. The rear of the squad car is near the curb but the front end of the car is 2 to 3 feet away from the curb. Also an examination of Commission Exhibit 523 and Barnes Exhibit D shows that the final position of Tippit’s car was directly in front of the driveway between 404 and 410 East Tenth Street. Could it be possible that Tippit saw something or someone between the houses at 404 and 410 East Tenth Street, hit the brakes quickly and then backed up his car in a hurry? This could explain why his car was parked at an angle, and it fits the events as were reported on the Kevin McCarthy Show. Bill Pulte also informs me that there are a series of east-west alleys in this section of Oak Cliff (See Westbrook Exhibit D ) and it would be possible for someone trying to use the alleys for concealment or to use them to try and travel undetected in that neighborhood. Just such an alley runs parallel with Tenth Street that is at the end of the properties at 404 and 410 East Tenth Street and it is possible to cut from the alley to any location on the south side of Tenth Street near where Tippit’s car was parked. Is it possible that Tippit was trying to locate someone and in the process encountered his murderer? In his Warren Commission testimony below Vol. 3 page 324-325 Scoggins gives some startling information about Tippit's activities. As we shall see Tippit was observed in the neighborhood that he was killed quite often. Mr. SCOGGINS. Well, I first seen the police car cruising east. Mr. BELlN. About how fast was it cruising? Mr. SCOGGINS. Not more than 10 or 12 miles a hour, I would say. Mr. BELIN. It was going east on what street? Mr. SCOGGINS. On Tenth. Mr. BELIN. All right. Did you see the police car go across right in front of yours? Mr. SCOGGINS. Yes; he went right down the street. He come from the west, going east On east Tenth. Mr. BELIN. Then what did you see? Mr. SCOGGINS. I noticed he stopped down there, and I wasn't paying too much attention to the man, you see, just used to see him every day , but then I kind of looked down the street, saw this, someone, that looked to me like he was going west, now, I couldn't exactly say whether he was going west or was in the process of turning around, but he was facing west when I saw him. Mr. BELIN. All right. Mr. SCOGGINS. And he was--he stopped there. Mr. BELIN. Let me ask you this now. When you first saw this man, had the police car stopped or not? It is amazing that Warren Commission Counsel David Belin did not ask any questions regarding the statement, just used to see him everyday , the implications of this testimony are very important. Scoggins gave his testimony on March 26,1964, one week later on April 2,1964 Mrs. Charlie Virginia Davis gave her testimony to the Warren Commission which independently corroborates Scoggins statements that Tippit was seen often near the spot that he was later murdered at. Mrs. Davis was an ear witness to the Tippit murder. She lived at 400 East 10th St. at the corner of Patton Ave. When she heard the gunfire both she and her sister-in-law, Mrs. Barbara Davis both ran to their front door in time to see the murderer escaping by walking across their front yard and South down Patton Ave.. The following testimony is from Vol. 6 page 458 of the Warren Commission Hearings. Mrs. DAVIS. No, sir; we just saw a police car sitting on the side of the road. Mr. BELIN. Where was the police car parked? Mrs. DAVIS. It was parked between the hedge that marks the apartment house where he lives in and the house next door . Mr. BELIN. Was it on your side of East 10th or the other side of the street? Mrs. DAVIS. It was on our side, the same side that we lived on. Mr. BELIN. Was it headed as you looked to the police car, towards your right or towards your left? Mrs. DAVIS. Right. Once again Counsel Belin heard testimony that Officer Tippit was in the neighborhood so much that Mrs. Davis thought that he lived there and once again he did not ask any questions to clarify the matter. The Warren Commission knew that Tippit did not live in this area, but because the proper questions were not asked we only have a vague outline of Tippit's regular activities in the neighborhood where he was killed. Author Dale Myers was able to interview Virginia Davis in 1997. She told Dale “I don’t know where J.D. Tippit lived” “I didn’t mean to say that I thought he lived there because we never seen the man or seen him cruising the streets or nothing until we seen him right there at the car” ( With Malice page 310-311). Thank you Dale Myers and Virginia Davis for clearing up this very important point. One of the main themes of this work is that Tippit was off his assigned patrol district on a regular basis for a variety of reasons. We know by the Davis and Scoggins testimony that he was seen near the murder sight on a daily basis. The reasons for his frequent visits there is beyond the scope of this writing, but it is something I would like to address at a future time. If it is ever positively proven that Oswald did not kill J.D. Tippit then the real murderer could have easily known where to find Tippit, since his activities were common knowledge to people in the neighborhood. Tippit was killed in Patrol District #91 which is about 4 miles from the closest point of Tippit's Patrol District #78. The travel time under normal conditions is about 13 minutes. Tippit Travel Time could have been 9-10 minutes. So here we have Tippit leaving his Patrol District driving to East 10th St., staying for an undetermined time and returning to his Patrol District. If he stayed at "the apartment house where he lives" for 10 minutes the minimum elapsed time to leave and return from is Patrol District is 30 minutes. Please remember that Tippit's squad car was parked at this location so often that Mrs. Davis thought he lived there. How often he made this trip and how long he would stay is anybody's guess. In the original article I mention the reoccurring theme that Tippit was sighted out of his patrol district often by several witnesses. Bill Pulte interviewed J.W. Finley who was Tippit’s sergeant for a period of time, and was later his lieutenant. When Pulte asked Finley if it would have been unusual for Tippit to be seen out of his assigned patrol district on a regular basis. Finley replied “No because J.D. was an officer that would drive around a lot”. Tippit investigator Ken M. Holmes Jr. related to me that he “did not think that it was out of the ordinary for Tippit to be out of his district so often” I stand corrected on making an issue of Tippit being sighted out of his district on a regular basis, I am thankful for this new insight from these sources. Officer J.D. Tippit was murdered a few moments after Helen Markham and William Scoggins saw him on 11/22/63 and because of circumstances outlined in this writing some of the true events of this day might never be known.
